Work continues apace on verge-rpg.com&#8217;s PHP.net-style documentation system.

Now we can add and edit sections, delete sections, and move sections to become sub-sections.

The whole process is audited, so viewing the history of a document and reverting to specific points in the document can be done.

The last thing to do with the documentation system is add/edit/remove functions from sections. This should be largely mechanical, and I may get to it later tonight&#8230;
