    Q: What about publishers stealing your great idea?
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    <b>Robert Boyd:</b> That doesn&#8217;t happen. Well, outside of Zynga. Me: Of course, it doesn&#8217;t happen. A great game isn&#8217;t a great idea. A great game is a host of great ideas, combined with hard work, talent, and passion. Publishers don&#8217;t pay for great ideas â€“ they pay for great studios who can deliver on great ideas. </div>
