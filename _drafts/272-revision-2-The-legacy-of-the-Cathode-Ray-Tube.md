The cathode ray tube is dead and gone, and its place there is _madness_. Utter, mindbending madness. Navigating through buying a new TV is a trip up the Nung River into the jungles of Cambodia, and if you return from the trip you will be a whithered, whimpering wreck of a man, grappling in the dark for an answer to whether it&#8217;s really necessary for audio cables to be braided from gold fibers by nubile virgins in a full moon on the solstice.

Will paying slightly more get you a slightly better TV or a much better TV? At what price point is the increase in quality marginal? Is 60hz better for 24fps movies or is 120hz? The 120 hz will do a better 3/2 pulldown, but will it be&#8230; flickery? Are the ludicrous contrast ratios claimed by LED backlit TVs actually as good as they say? So they are when the entire screen is black and white, but how much light spill is there? How do you measure color quality? Which brand has the correct make? Should you wait for OLED tvs, or maybe pick up the more mature but increasingly obsolete plasma technology cheaper? What kind of angle are you likely to watch a movie from?

You will, certainly, go insane. Durring the process a person is likely to despair, and give up on buying anything since you&#8217;re going to have to buy _something_ that _somebody_ warns against buying. Also, remove from your head the idea that you&#8217;re going to be able to make an informed decision, to decide what kind of viewing angle or refresh rates cater to your personal TV use. It&#8217;s impossible.

Eventually you&#8217;ll realize this, and you&#8217;ll stop being able to listen to anything anybody has to say on the matter, and you&#8217;ll have to do what everyone ends up doing anyway. You&#8217;ll pick a price point, you&#8217;ll go to a Best Buy or Fry&#8217;s or whatever, you&#8217;ll go find the best looking TV for around that price, and without reading any other specs about it you&#8217;ll write down the model and go buy it online. Then while you&#8217;re waiting for the TV to be delivered, you&#8217;ll learn all the specs and pick all the rationalizations for why that contrast ratio or brightness is best. Or better yet, you&#8217;ll google it, find the best review it&#8217;s ever gotten, and then say you trust that particular author more than anyone else.

And if you do that to start with, you won&#8217;t have to go insane.
