For the first time since 2001, I&#8217;m taking place in a [verge compo](http://beta.verge-rpg.com/forums/news/240hov-how-about-m-has-begun).

I&#8217;m on a team with Gayo, [Zathras](http://zath.org/), [Hyptosis](http://lorestrome.com), and [Ustor](http://wundermint.com), and we&#8217;re Making an M-game. Hopefully this will get the Zeldalike urges out of my system.

We&#8217;ve got a walk&#8217;n&#8217;slash demo at this point, several chrs, a massive amount of raw mapwork, and music engaged. Still left to do are the tool scripts, the actual map-scripting, and playtesting. We&#8217;re on schedule for now, but I&#8217;d like to be ahead of schedule just because tragedy can strike at any moment.

Tragedy is a ninja, see&#8230;
