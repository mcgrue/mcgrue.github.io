In the car early this morning I heard a news report that said a russian space capsule had landed bringing back &#8220;two _Astronauts_, a Canadian and a Belgian, and one Russian _Cosmonaut_&#8221; back to earth.

I thought Astronaut was the term for American spacemen. We have Cosmonaut for the Russians and Taikonaut for the Chinese. Why share our term for space travellers with other NATO countries? 

And so, I submit this list of &#8216;nauts:  
Canadians: Maplenaut  
Belgians: Wafflenaut
