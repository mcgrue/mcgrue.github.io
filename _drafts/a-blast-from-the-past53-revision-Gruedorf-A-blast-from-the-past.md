      A lot of what SotS is to me currently is an echo of an echo of what it used to be. It&#8217;s been many, many years since I had the whole thing in my head. At best I think of it in broad strokes now. So I sorta wanted a refresher on the original. So I started massaging it into v3 as an exercise&#8230; and hoo boy, does our v1->v3 path suck.

      I&#8217;ll spare the details. <a href="http://www.egometry.com/files/gruedorf_challenge/045/ancient_sots_001.rar">Here&#8217;s a zip of the Amaxis library, playable in v3</a>. SotS&#8217;s original version had a lot of text in it!
