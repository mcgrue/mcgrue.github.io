      I didn&#8217;t mean to let this post get so late. almost five days now. My ever-tardy master nemesis <a href=http://speveril.northknight.com/>Kildorf</a>, who is of this writing <i>41 days tardy</i> must be sapping my will to be punctual. I might have to choose a new enemy! <a href=http://chocolatesaucerpgdev.blogspot.com/>glambourine</a> looks like an ideal target, what with his pristine 0.0% loss and tantalizingly long, screenshot-laden posts. Ohhh yeah, the &#8216;dorf is strong with this one. Much stronger than in the actual &#8216;Dorf.

      Anyways: what I&#8217;ve been working on recently is a battle group editor for Gayo for Sully. In the interests of getting as much going on as possible with all mah peeps, I figured it was time to finally get my hands dirty in the land of c# win32 apps. The concept is simple: you load <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/trunk/res/data/battle_group.dat>a .dat file (anonymous/anonymous)</a>, and the app parses out all the unique locations and enemy group contained within. You can then visually add, delete, or edit the existing groups, then save a new file out.

      So that&#8217;s that! This here&#8217;s a mockup picture, as the drawing canvas is only a 320&#215;240 magenta square in the real version, but the verge battle group file parsing and drop downs are done. I&#8217;ll be getting to the custom canvas code shortly. Mad props to my &#8220;homeboy&#8221; and &#8220;roommate&#8221;, <a href=>kael</a>, who&#8217;s very familiar in these areas and generally knows what I&#8217;m looking for within a sentence or two of frustrated explaination. There&#8217;s no svn for this unnamed project yet, but if anyone actually wants to play with the WIP, just email me. I&#8217;m all about being open up in this kimono, baby.
