**Mission Date:** 0 years, 250 days

On Day 0, it was 93%. At the time of our first flyby, it had been downgraded to 86%. By the time of our second flyby, during the one day window where live communication was possible with the Earth, the official number was 83% . Today a story ran that we&#8217;d been downgraded to 67%. These are the findings of the UN Astrophysics Lab, estimating the probability that Alpha Centauri&#8217;s fourth planet is habitable. And we&#8217;re talking about a very low standard for habitability. Habitable, in their definition, means that landing makes more sense to just staying in space.
