Welcome back to the visual tutorial for where all of the cameras that you can destrol in in Valve&#8217;s new Portal game are. This is the second (of two) parts and the <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>first one</a> can be found <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>by clicking here</a>.

Note that the photo essay thing here is mainly for &#8220;that one effing camera&#8221; you can&#8217;t find. Really, just knowing how many cameras you should find on each level is enough to get anyone through to completetion on this Achievement, and you can find that list at the top of <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>part one of this tutorial</a>.

Enough chitchat. Let&#8217;s break some cameras.

### Level 10

<a title="After 4 brief, empty levels devoid of any form of cameras, Valve rewards us for our patience by putting one right in plain view." href="/i/13/full/10_30_twelfth_camera_1.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/10_30_twelfth_camera_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

After 4 brief, empty levels devoid of any form of cameras, Valve rewards us for our patience by putting one right in plain view.

<a title="ETHNIC_TERM_FOR_GOOBYE_HERE, sucker.  You have chosen ARRIVEDERCI.  To confirm this selection, press ONE." href="/i/13/full/10_31_twelfth_camera_dead.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/10_31_twelfth_camera_dead.jpg" alt="" /></a>

ETHNIC\_TERM\_FOR\_GOOBYE\_HERE, sucker.

You have chosen ARRIVEDERCI. To confirm this selection, press ONE.

### Level 11

<a title="The one camera on this level is a tricky one.  I actually missed it the first time this go-round, and had to restart from level 05.  Of course, that was a 8 minute diversion, so no big loss. Lesson learned: always turn around." href="/i/13/full/11_34_thirteenth_camera_1.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/11_34_thirteenth_camera_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

The one camera on this level is a tricky one. I actually missed it the first time this go-round, and had to restart from level 05. Of course, that was a 8 minute diversion, so no big loss.

**Lesson learned**: _always turn around_.

We will now pause to do the obligatory &#8220;playing with Portals Physics&#8221; things.

Licking my own feet while not bending over is the second least naughty thing I&#8217;d do had I my own portable wormhole generator.

<a title="Level fifteen already.  My, how time flies.  This level has five (soon to be four) cameras.  It also has the first reference by GLADoS to the infamous cake that has become a plague upon the hearts and minds of the entire internet this week.  Delicious and Infectious.  German Chocolate Meme cake. By the way, you can get through the previous (cameraless) level really quickly by doing a fling-jump with a portal on the floor next to the exit, and jumping into the other portal from a great height.  It takes a few seconds." href="/i/13/full/15_46_seventeenth_camera_1.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/15_46_seventeenth_camera_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<a title="And our last friend here is right above the exit archway from the moving platform puzzle.

I wonder what that googl... augh!  Ventriloquist mimes!

The penalty for drollness is death.

<a title="The first two times I played this I had Options>Video>Advanced>Texture Detail set to low (Hey, I'm rockin&apos; an ancient card here).  So I couldn&apos;t read these guys at all.  All very blurry.  All very... sad.  So, I hear that the pastry might be... a fabrication?  Could the confection be mendacious?  Yes.  Yes, it appears that, in fact, the cake is a lie.

### Level 18

<a title="There are two cameras of import in this level.  This was my least favorite level my first time through.  I couldn't figure out how to do the jump in the giant turret-having room.
