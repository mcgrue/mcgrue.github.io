I was in the doctor&#8217;s office today, and just as a Hobbit Hole means Comfort, a doctor&#8217;s office means _waiting_.

So I pulled out my trusty iPhone looking for some diversion. After catching up on my <a href=http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific>Twitter feed</a>, I looked around hungrily for something new. I scanned through the games section and tried to buy the <a href=http://gizmodo.com/5070894/square-enix-making-final-fantasy-based-iphone-game>Square-Enix iPhone Game</a> only to be told to go bugger off because it was over 10mb in size and I wasn&#8217;t on a wifi network.

Balls.

So I went through what apps I had locally, and decided to give the paint app I&#8217;d downloaded months ago a fair shakedown. I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with it in the past, but I didn&#8217;t spend more than a minute trying. And now I had all the time in the world&#8230; or at least in the office.
