# Benjamin McGraw, Mad Genius

I&#8217;m just this guy, you know?

So, the first place I ever had was cozy. Quaint, really. Cramped. But the heat worked and the rent was cheap.

I hermitted there for a while, got some thinking done. It&#8217;s easiest when you&#8217;re left alone, I find. Other people are hell, and the internet is other people cubed.

So, one day I decide to step outside and get some fresh air. I&#8217;d been cooped up for a good nine months or so, and I was getting a little stir crazy.

First guy I meet slaps me silly until I cry. True story. I mean, who _does_ that?

From that moment on, I vowed to wreak my vengeance on them. On them all! Mwa ha ha. Mwahaha.

# Okay, now what

I&#8217;m a programmer-guy.

I&#8217;m actually platform agnostic: I won&#8217;t get into holy wars about any platform, but I&#8217;ll often speak up for the underdog because, you know, who wants to be a yes-man? The only language I&#8217;ve met that I&#8217;ve hated is PERL, although C++ and I are having a trial separation at the moment.

I learned how to program while attempting to make <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/>games using VERGE</a>. That didn&#8217;t go very well for the game-making, but it did well for the learning. Somewhere along the line I became a professional webcoderman. It probably had something to do with all of the hipness and coolness associated with the webcoderman lifestyle. I mean, I get to wear bandanas and hoodies to work while making crazy Donnie Darko-like expressions!

I have a bunch of projects. That&#8217;s all I gotta say about that for now.

# There&#8217;s a ninja hiding in me

No, really. He&#8217;s here. Ninjas are very clever. I&#8217;m pretty sure that all Be**<u>nja</u>**m**<u>in</u>**s have their own personal ninja, somewhere, deep down inside.

# Ephemera

If you want to see a bunch of badges for which to cyber stalk me even easier, but which aren&#8217;t worthy of being in my main layout, <a href=http://www.egometry.com/about/ephemera-misceâ€¦era-ad-nauseumephemera-miscellany-et-cetera-et-cetera-ad-nauseum/>go to my junk draw
