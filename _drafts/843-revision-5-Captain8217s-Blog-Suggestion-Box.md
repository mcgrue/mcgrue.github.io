I&#8217;ve thought very hard about what needs to be done to save the morale on this ship. In fact this journal serves, in part, the same purpose as a black box on an airplane.  This is not to say I&#8217;m not trying to save it, I am, but if that&#8217;s not in the cards I&#8217;d like future historians to have some idea of how this happened. It&#8217;s already become impossible to be remotely honest with UNSC about what&#8217;s happening here, and communication has become infrequent and insubstantial.

That said, I have no idea what to do and I&#8217;ve reached the point of near despair. Not knowing what to do I decided to appeal to the crew, and ask them what should be done. I&#8217;ve gone to the time honored tradition of last resort, the stately suggestion box.

Most of the &#8220;suggestions&#8221; weren&#8217;t actually suggestions but detailed critiques of the concept or execution of a suggestion box. I&#8217;ll have to tell Dr. Saratoga to add &#8220;insufferable know-it-all&#8221; to the list of character flaws everyone on this ship seems to have. Apart from that, there many serious but terrible suggestions, like having dances or cooking classes or getting-to-know-your-shipsmates events. One suggestion caught my eye.

It was truly special. I have yet to tell someone about the idea and not see an instant smile appear on their faces. Sociologists giggle with glee. Engineers eyes widen and they start scribbling madly, trying to figure out how it could be possible. The most dreary face livens instantly, and age lines seem to disappear from peoples faces.

I&#8217;m preparing my speech to the crew. I have hope the Ennui can be saved with a simple idea. &#8220;Zero Gravity Wednesdays&#8221;.

**Mission Date**: 0 years, 238 days.

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  Be it hereby resolved that we, the Crew and Captain of the UNSS Ennui do fully intend to implement Zero Gravity Wednesdays.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  Whereas the deep beaurocratic problems of the UNSS Ennui are actually beaurocratic problems of the UN,
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  Whereas the disharmony on board the UNSS Ennui is a reflection of the disharmony of the member states,
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  Whereas a solution has been found, is universally support by the Crew and Captain of the UNSS Ennui but is being opposed by UNSC to avoid embarrassment,
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  Whereas the alternative to Zero Gravity Wednesdays is the inevitable total loss of this mission,
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  And Whereas we are far beyond the point where we can be recalled or assisted by the UN in any capicity other than advice,
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  We, the Crew and Captain of the UNSS do resolve that further interference by the UNSC with the swift implimentation of Zero Gravity Wednesdays is equal and tantamount to violation of our basic human right to self determination.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;">
  <em>United We Stand. Wednesdays we float.</em>

I should stop writing binding resolutions I don&#8217;t intend to send.
