[Large picture of jesus on the cross]  
This is what St. Valentine was thinking of while being tortured to death

And where were you? Desperately trying to get laid by a girl who was pretending to have a good time? Desperately trying to convince yourself the halfhearted effort the guy made for you actually made you happy? Watching youtube and eating corn flakes, and later on breaking out the hand towel you only use for special occasions?

_I&#8217;ll pray for you_, hedonist.
