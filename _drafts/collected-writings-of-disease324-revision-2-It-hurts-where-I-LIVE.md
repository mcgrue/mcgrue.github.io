You know you&#8217;re retarded sick when your eyes hurt. That&#8217;s right, retarded sick. I&#8217;ve been sleeping all day, my nose is stupid red, an entire roll of toilet paper is crumpled up into little wads next to my bed, and my body can&#8217;t make up its mind what temperature it wants to be. Right now I feel hot AND I&#8217;m sweating, a rare bit of consistency from an otherwise barely functioning wreck of a thing. Too high, you say? Well fuck you, body. You wanted it hot, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to get you son of a bitch.

I catches me off guard that I can&#8217;t talk. If you go a good 12 hours without speaking to anyone it suprises you when you try and find you can&#8217;t.

It occurs to me that this might seem like I&#8217;m begging for pity so let me explain how my life is still better than yours.

First off, location, location, location. I get to be sick as a dog in NYC. If there were a place in the world to not be able to enjoy, NY is the one you&#8217;d get the most non-enjoyment from. The awesome job I&#8217;m staying home from, and that isn&#8217;t paying me while I do, is awesome.
