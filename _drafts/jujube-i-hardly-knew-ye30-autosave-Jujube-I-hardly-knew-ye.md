### Jujube, I hardly knew ye!

<div style="float: right; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">
  <img src=/files/gruedorf_challenge/022/2008-03-24_0-jujube_water.png><br /> <span style="color: silver; font-size: -1;"><br /> <br />So many pretty layers!</span>
</div>

So, today I finished Station 3 of Jujube, added two layers of waterfall to the entire map, hooked up the installed <a href=http://eskelley.com/blog/2008/03/and-the-bridge-will-bring-us-b.html target=_new>Esk&#8217;s Bridge</a>. This bridge has a long and sordid story, the history of which you&#8217;ll need to read Esk&#8217;s post for and then my comment at the bottom.  


Look at us: Gruedorfers working together towards a common goal. At least, Esk isn&#8217;t my <a target=_new href=http://speveril.northknight.com/>arch nemesis</a>, <a href=http://speveril.northknight.com/node/83 target=_new>who most assuredly didn&#8217;t do anything for sully today</a>, because he&#8217;s a wanton jerk and maker of nothing good.

### OMG, downloadable file!

And that&#8217;s it. Get the update via SVN <a href=http://verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/trunk/ target=_new>here</a>. Or, actually, since everything is hella awesome, just [download a WIP copy of this build of Sully here](/files/gruedorf_challenge/022/Sully Chronicles, 2008.03.24 build.rar). You&#8217;ll want to load save 5 and walk to the northeast to see the jujube work!
