Finished the files section of beta.verge-rpg pretty well for now. Moved on to the last major section to port: the documentation system. Less than a day into it and the core display functionality seems to be nearly complete. This may turn out to go fairly quickly to get to the point where I can cut the site over. 

Several times I&#8217;ve been asked &#8220;why don&#8217;t you just use a wiki&#8221;? Scraping the data out of the existing documentation and forcing it into a wiki, and shoehorning a wiki into the same login system as the site seems like it&#8217;d be actually more work than just writing a simple custom display/edit shim in cakePHP. I&#8217;ve put maybe 5 hours total into the view logic and it&#8217;s already showing the first of the three types of page involved in the documentation system.

Also, this system was originally built to mimic PHP.net&#8217;s documentation system, which was the best part of PHP. Hopefully this iteration will improve that.

On r431. And back in gruedorf.
