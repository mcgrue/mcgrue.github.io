### Saga of the Sully?

Today&#8217;s update on the ongoing adventure of SotS&#8217;s creation takes us to The Sully Chronicles.

&#8230;What? 

For about three years now I&#8217;ve been planning on basing the SotS Battle System off of the one that I&#8217;ve been working on for The Sully Chronicles. 

Unfortunately, the Sully Chronicles battle system was 1) never completed and 2) is currently in a state of disgrace.

It&#8217;s got a lot in place&#8230; a real lot! But to cut a very long story short, it&#8217;s in need of quality assurance and some heavy refactoring before it&#8217;s really ready for public use.

### o/~ It&#8217;s time to chaaaange o/~

So, it turns out I&#8217;m moving across the country next week and starting a new job with the awesome chaps over at <a href=http://IMVU.com>IMVU.com</a>. They&#8217;re an impressive bunch of engineers there, and pre-populated with such GCE community superstars as AegisKnight (creator of Sphere, Audiere, Corona, and umpteen million other things. Also probably your mom.), TheSpeedBump (creator of Ika), Kael (creator of Fury<sup>2</sup>), and verge&#8217;s own aen!

The pertinent matter to this post being the development techniques they use over at IMVU, and it&#8217;s effect upon the sully codebase. The problem with Sully at the moment are hard to track errors stemming from a lack of accountability within the code. Turns out that the boys, nay, _men_ of IMVU are huge, huge, HUGE proponents of Test Driven Design. So&#8230; I&#8217;m planning on applying the techniques I&#8217;m going to have drummed into my head over the next few weeks to Sully so forward progress can be made again.

I&#8217;ll revise this post more shortly. Let me post this bitch so it doesn&#8217;t look like I lost first. >_> 

### Lookit teh pretty werks:

<a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/>http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/</a> for the sully repository. Notice the nice, new trunk/branches dichotomy. Exciting, eh?
