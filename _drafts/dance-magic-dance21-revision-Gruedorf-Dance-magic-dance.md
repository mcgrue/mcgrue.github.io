### Gruedorf: Dance magic dance.

</div>

Today I completed the first version of the third major revision of Prince Onam Alden. That&#8217;s right: Onam 3.0. Unless you start counting at the recolored version of Edgar Figaro, in which case this is 4.0.

In either case, here he is: lower color, slightly larger, and not based directly upon any other game&#8217;s. That&#8217;s right, this little guy for better or worse was done sans template. I went with an asymmetrical stance based on years of admiring Chrono Trigger&#8217;s take (I still am in awe of how much they packed in so little space.), and use bright primary colors taking a cue from Lufia&#8217;s sense of design. As a result, the sprites are off-center and the sides don&#8217;t match up perfectly.

I&#8217;m mostly pleased with them, and if y&#8217;all have any feedback, please: feel free to email me. Or post on the <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/boards/general/ target=_new>general discussion board of verge-rpg.com</a>. I promise one day I&#8217;ll implement comments here. I just have too many projects and not enough time&#8230;

### More done than expected?

      One of the side effects of the simplified sprites of this revision is that it&#8217;s a bit easier to cook up a finished sprite. The previous version had five frames per direction, whereas this new version has only three. That&#8217;s a total of 12 versus 20. In addition, I limited the colors I used intentionally to further speed the coloring process. With less colors, there&#8217;s less fussing over how best to shade some newly exposed area. So with 40% less frames and each frame taking less time to color, I was able to fully crank out Tanata here from scratch in under 40 minutes. Stuff like this matters when you&#8217;ve got a limited amount of time&#8230;

      Tanata here is a major character that has yet to be seen in a released version of The Astrad. For those of you lurking since 1997, she&#8217;s the princess of a the kingdom of Allrusen, which was on the other side of the mountain pass my final &#8220;real&#8221; demo ended at. I&#8217;ve always liked women who could kick ass, and Tanata here does just that. She&#8217;s the only character in the game who lacks magical abilities, and plays the role of the tank and the physical damage powerhouse.

      She is also black, which&#8230; has rarely been seen in sprite characters. Shockingly, I will be breaking from RPG tradition by <i>not</i> arbitrarily making my dark-skinned characters speak ebonics.

      This is my fourteenth consecutive gruedorf entry, and I&#8217;m showing no signs of giving up this ghost. What would a gruedorf be without a grue, after all? As always, my revisions can be snatched and audited over at <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/>http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/</a>. I&#8217;m almost finished settling into my new place in Mountain View, CA (home of <a href=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=6762608055434308812,37.423154,-122.084918&time=&date=&ttype=&q=1600+Amphitheatre+Parkway,+Mountain+View,+CA+94043&sll=37.423872,-122.084917&sspn=0.00484,0.010042&ie=UTF8&ll=37.423565,-122.085056&spn=0.009679,0.020084&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1 target=_new>teh google</a>). So hopefully I&#8217;ll be kicking ass and taking names in short order.
