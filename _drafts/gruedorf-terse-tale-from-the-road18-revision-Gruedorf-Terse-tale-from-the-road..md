Retrieved and updated roobarb and reverse-engineered it&#8217;s xml format to test the old &#8220;new&#8221; onam animation, and used the tool to diagnose and fix it. And all this from the back seat of a stationary rental car in a denny&#8217;s parking lot in Wooster, Mass at a late hour. VERY SUSPICIOUS.

check the svn for the goods. Will explain more after 4 more hours of driving.
