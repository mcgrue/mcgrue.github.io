Use one of these a day:

  * A rat always knows when he&#8217;s in with weasels
  * They&#8217;re lining up to go insane.
  * That deep blue sky is my home
  * Independent as a hog on ice
  * it was all ripe for dreaming
  * And all the donuts have names that sound like prostitutes
  * Stayin&#8217; out of circulation till the dogs get tired
  * At night I pray and clean my gun
  * I feel like a preacher waving a gun around
  * God used me as a hammer boy to beat his weary drum today
  * Damn good address for a rat
  * the day when home early and the sun sank down into the muck of a deep dead sky
  * I&#8217;d like to hammer this ring into a bullet
  * I&#8217;m not Able, I&#8217;m just Cain
  * They sharpen their knives on my mistakes
  * There&#8217;s always free cheddar in a mousetrap, baby
  * Man&#8217;s a fiddle that life plays on
  * They that dance must pay the fiddler
  * Don&#8217;t go dreaming, don&#8217;t go scheming
  * Well my friends think I&#8217;m ugly I got a masculine face
  * Don&#8217;t trust a bull&#8217;s horn, a doberman&#8217;s tooth, a runaway horse or me
  * Like a kid who captures a firefly, leaves it only to die in a jar
  * Who ever thought hell&#8217;d be so cold?
  * I wanna look in the mirror and see another face
  * Yellow dog knows when he&#8217;s sinned
  * The carpet needs a haircut
  * He&#8217;s been seen at the table with kings
  * He can turn himself into a stranger
  * everything this doughboy does is wrong

Or describe a girl as

  * &#8220;tawny moore&#8221;
  * &#8220;sad luck dame&#8221;
  * &#8220;Nothing wrong with her that $100 won&#8217;t fix&#8221;
  * &#8220;all liquored up on that road house corn&#8221;
  * Hair black as a bucket of tar, skin as white as a cuttlefish bone
  * I was the jewel of her sin
  * <span><span class="txt_1">Salvation Army Band girl</span></span>
  * <span><span class="txt_1"><br /> </span></span>

Advanced mode

  * Your love is a faucet
  * Got a wooden coat, this boy is never coming home
  * The cracked bell rings as the ghost bird sings and the gods go begging here
  * I feel like a slave ship upside down wrecked beneath the waves of a grain
  * And by the time they played &#8220;Moanin Low&#8221; I was soakin&#8217; wet and wild eyed. And Doctor Bliss slipped me a preparation and I fell asleep with &#8216;Livery Stable Blues&#8217; in my ear
  * There&#8217;s always some killin&#8217; you got to do around the farm
  * For want of a bird the sky was lost
  * whittled from the bone of Cain
  * There are those who say beneath his coat there are <strong style="color: black; background-color: #ff9999;">wings</strong>
