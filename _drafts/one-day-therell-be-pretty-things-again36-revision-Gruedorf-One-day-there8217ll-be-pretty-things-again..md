### One day there&#8217;ll be pretty things again&#8230;

So, here&#8217;s what I did this week:

  * Fixed the battle selection code. There were problems with the selectmap&#8217;s setup that were causing terrible, horrible, really bad problems. I was afraid it was a much more complicated problem than it ended up being. Go team venture! Clearing up this problem removed the last &#8220;major&#8221; bug blocking battle system development.
  * Added the vc code to add <a href=http://speveril.northknight.com/node/97>Kildorf&#8217;s new cels</a> into Sully.
  * Augmented <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/trunk/verge.exe>verge.exe</a> so that if you use textpad&#8217;s tool option to run your verge game, and it exits, you can click on the output and it&#8217;ll open the right file at the right line number. This is, by the way, <u>awesome</u>.
  * Reformatted the skills.dat file, and implemented the white magic spells \*Shield and \*Revive.
  * Fixed selection so skills that require targets with specific conditions (like &#8220;can only be used on dead allies&#8221;) don&#8217;t let you select them if there are no valid targets on the field.

Isn&#8217;t that swell? As per the usual, you can grab all these updates and much, much more over at <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/>The Sully Chronicles SVN</a>. One day I&#8217;ll do something with more exciting explanations and pretty pictures&#8230; but for now I&#8217;m more interested in actually doing lots of work than in doing lots of explanation. Sorry!
