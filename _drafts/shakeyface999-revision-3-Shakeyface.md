I went to <a href=http://www.fantasticfest.com/>Fantasticfest</a> this summer for vacation. It was fantastic.

It&#8217;s a film festival, and as such, they have photo badges.

They request that you make a <a href=http://www.fantasticfest.com/blog/2010/09/zack-carlson-demonstrates-the-art-of-shakey-face/>shakeyface</a> for this badge&#8217;s photo.

<a href=http://sophia-foster-dimino.com/>Sophia</a> helped me take mine. And she just composed all of the reject shots into this gif:
