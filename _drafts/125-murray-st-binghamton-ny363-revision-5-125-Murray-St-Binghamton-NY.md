The place I had with Tobias and Jonah in Binghamton in 2002 was my favorite place so far in life. It was awesome. Here&#8217;s a panorama of the living room after we&#8217;d decorated it:

The ceilings were so high in this place. Also, we didn&#8217;t have wireless ethernet. I still prefer wired to this day.

The bar. I miss the bar. I bought the bar new from Oak Express when we were decking the place out.

That bar and I have had good times.

It looks like good times were had immediately prior to taking these pictures, actually.
