So, I have a problem.

I love my iPhone and Zune 120, but I _hate_ albums that don&#8217;t have cover art.

And a lot of my music comes from [Overclocked Remix](http://www.ocremix.org/).

Now, they have [](http://www.ocremix.org/albums)several compilations and all of those have cover art, but there are so many delicious standalone tracks based on video game music.

Tracks like [](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01560)Ilari Nieminen&#8217;s &#8216;Lake in Ontario?, which is a superawesome Yes/ELO/Prog Rock remix of a few of Final Fantasy X&#8217;s themes.

Tracks like [](http://www.ocremix.org/remix/OCR01762)The OneUp&#8217;s &#8216;Terra Haute&#8217;, which is like a Chuck Mangione rendition of Terra&#8217;s Theme from Final Fantasy Six.

I could go on. There are too many good tracks. Regardless, they always come up with a terrible default album art in modern mp3 players. And so, I took it upon myself to spend 3 minutes making something appropriate. And here it is fo you to enjoy as well!
