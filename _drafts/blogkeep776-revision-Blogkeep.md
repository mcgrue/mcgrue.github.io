Hello fellow Bloodpact Bloggers!

This is just a maintenance post.  [Ben Mathes](http://catch-and-sing-the-sun-in-flight.blogspot.com/) asked me to remove him from the aggregator a while ago, and I just got around to doing it.

And in so doing, I got to wondering: does anyone else still really use this rss?

And after a smashing meal last night with several of the old &#8216;pact, I was also wondering in the complete opposite direction: does anyone want to go another round?  Either with the old grindmill once-a-day rules, or perhaps a more leisurely variant on the [gruedorf](http://verge-rpg.com/boards/display_thread.php?id=131619) rules?
