Magic: The Gathering is a complex, and now long-lived, game with a strong social component. As it&#8217;s based on two (or more) people duking it out mano-e-mano (or sometimes womano-e-mano, or the very rare womano-e-womano), it&#8217;s developed it&#8217;s own slang dialect.

In this section I hope to catalog this sub-language specific to Magic: the Gathering.
