# A drawer of crap!

So I was cleaning my room today (2004.09.22), and I came to the top-left drawer of my desk, the one that sits at my left hand to judge over the unworthy and recieves my blessing in the form of various crap that I don&#8217;t want on top of my desk or in immediate view.

This drawer had been accumulating various junk over the previous year or so, and everything deposited in there was done so so that it was out of the way but accessible for later organization of memories. Sadly, my valet box is _still_ in Lacona, so I don&#8217;t have anywhere to deposit all the miscellany tokens and trinkets of my travels.

Enter: the Intarweb.

I rememebered that I had this-here homepage thingy and various pieces of technology to let me immortalize this disarray for later fond memory-recalling. So I figured, what the hell, and did something pointlessly egocentric. _Finally_. This site was in danger of needing to be re-registered as Humblometry. Or Borometry. And it still does quality for that last one. C&#8217;est la vie.

So without further adieu, A day in the life of one Desk Drawer before it&#8217;d been purged just hours ago. As an aside, I stopped cleaning my room about 10 hours ago to do this, and am just now finishing. Not all the time was spent on the creation of this page by far, but none of the time was spent continuing the cleaning job.

**Procrastination**: _successful_.

    Movie Tickets

  <p>
    Exciting! Three movie tickets! Master and Commander (entertaining), Matrix: Revolutions (much better than the revues gave it credit for) , and Kill Bill (vol 1) (OMG Rocktastic).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Seen at 2003.11.23, 2003.11.27, and 2003.10.13 respectively. That&#8217;d be the first time I saw Kill Bill, then, since I saw it again a few days later at vcon.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    $15 total was spent on these: two at the student price of $5, and once at the matinee price. Good to see that I was saving on the matinee.

  <p>
    This is a copy of the Fall 2003 schedule from Binghamton University&#8217;s <a href=http://www.whrwfm.org/ target=_new>student radio station</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I picked it up at the end of the fall semester because the theme was neat. <a href=./drawer_radio.php>Click here</a> to examine it closer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I did, however, learn that anyone in the community can get a program on WHRW, student or no. If I ever get any number of chums to live in Binghamton as a Nerd Development Farm, I want to procure one of these shows and play tracked music from across the ages.

    A temporary Tattoo of Diablo from <a href=http://goats.com/ target=_new>Goats.com</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m a <a href=http://www.goats.com/premium/ target=_new>premium member</a> over there, so once a year I get a big satchel of junk from them. Last year, in addition to the T-shirts, books, comics, stickers, and buttons in the SPEY package, we were sent a whole passel of these Temporary Tattoos they had printed up a few years ago.

    Frequent Flier Card

  <p>
    I don&#8217;t frequently fly, but I have a card that says I do. This, as many of the items here are, is from Vergecon 7&#8230; or at least exists because of it.

    Awesome, only 29 more trips until I get to go somewhere for free.

    I was considerably less drunk on that flight than I was the previous time I left MN for NY.

    Card Catalog Card

  <p>
    To the educate man, it appears I would have an interest in philosophy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This hypothetical erudite would be correct, because I am a wanker. However, the conclusion has derived from seeing Jung&#8217;s name on a card in my possession has nothing to do with this fact.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every library I&#8217;ve used in recent times have converted to electrnoic card catalogs, and they&#8217;ve universally turned their old cards into scrap paper. EMPs will be the librarian&#8217;s nemesis in coming wars.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The note in question on this card reads "PR3560 1800". A quick google tells me that this is Milton&#8217;s Paradise Lost.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    See, told you I was a wanker.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Of note is that, as of this writing, I actually have not yet returned that book. I probably owe Binghamton University quite a sum. But it was the annotated Paradise Lost by Issac Asimov, so it&#8217;s worth it.

    Minneapolis Bus Passes
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    Bus passes from Vergecon 7.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One was on bus 3050, issued at 11:49 AM on October 20th (obviously the bus leaving Hahn&#8217;s dwelling for the airport). It was local on route 1016, heading east, and would&#8217;ve expired at 2:19 PM
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The other was bus 863 issued at 1:42 PM on the 16th of October, Route 1007 (heading south). I think this might&#8217;ve been the one from the Airport *to* the city, but I&#8217;m just guessing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Minneapolis had good busses all told. And you get unlimited transfers for 150 minutes with them. That beats Binghamton&#8217;s, which are also exceptionally good busses, but where you only get one transfer and it has to be consecutive. No popping off to the mall on one trip here, nosireebob. You have to pay them each way. Targic.

    The Triforce!
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    I was in a building Supplies store for some reason long since tossed to the winds of time. For some reason, I seem to remember <a href=http://core.binghamton.edu/~jthm/ target=_new>Kelly</a> there, although this could be a horrible fabrication. There was a girl there, and there had to be a car-owner there, so Kelly&#8217;s a likely choice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Anyways, I saw this laying out in the open, somewhere near a display of something that was being built. It was so lonely and so unattended, and as soon as I saw it I knew I had to make it mine.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I guess it&#8217;s the insignia of some sort of&#8230; something?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At any rate, I&#8217;m not one for kleptomania but I figured it wasn&#8217;t so bad. The blue triforce sticker means more to me than it would to the display model that was being built up. Usually this sorta thing gets tossed from displays, too.

  <p>
    Coffeehouses often have Frequent Drinker programs, especially if they&#8217;re exceptionally overpriced coffeehouses. "Hey", you say, "Sure this coffee is about 500% over what should be charged for it, but if I buy 6, I get one free!"

  <p>
    Of note is that the Library Tower has no books in it. Well, at least no library books. I&#8217;m sure the offices have books of some type in them.

    This is a photo I stole from a stack of photos at my parent&#8217;s house spanning from 1979-1983.

    Taco Bell Receipt!
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    For the interested, it appears I had quite a quantity of tacos on November 18th, 2003.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For the anally interested, This order appears to have been one Nachos Belgrande Combo, three beef soft tacos, a mystery item labelled FBGSST, and two large sodas.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I apparently was buying for two that day. Or I was very thirsty.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The total was $12.47, and $1.03 in tax brought that to $13.50, to which I tendered a Jackson and recieved back a Lincoln, a Washington, and two smaller, harder Washingtons.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At any rate, I am quite sure the tacos were delicious.

    Index Card Notes
  </h1>
  
  <p>
    I use a stack of index cards for all sorts of notes. These three show:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Songs from <a href=http://lucasarts.vintagegaming.org/index.php?do=game&gameid=5>Loom</a> (oooh, DDCD turns things green&#8230; that means DCDD makes things that were green become not-green!)<br /> This card also appears to have blood on it. <i>Awesome!</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      a list of restaurants that I get discover cashback from in walking distance (Little Venice has good Martinis)
    </li>
    <li>
      A quick sketch of Sully for a speech portrait (on the back of the index card with all my root passwords on it).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Of particular note here are two things. Firstly, this very page has an index card for it (listing each item numerically for reference), and secondly, that someone, somewhere, sometime will attempt to edit a copy of this image to reveal the passwords on the other side of that card.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Good luck, haxx0rs, and godspeed.

  <p>
    Amanda demanded a present from my trip out to Vergecon 7. So, in the interests of Being Awesome, I purchased her a <a href=http://www.toyvault.com/cthulhu/plush_cthulhu.html target=_new>plush Cthulu</a> from <a href=http://www.sourcecandg.com/ target=_new>The Source</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He was quite affordably priced for being an all-powerful evincar of doom, destruction and overall bane of humankind. And he&#8217;s adorable when not chewing on my teddybear. Poor MacBeth put up a good fight while they were cohabitating, though, as is evidenced by all of his limbs being still there.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In all of my years of being a good little consumer, this was probably my wisest and best purchase.

    I used to have a NYC subway token too, but I have no idea where that went.
  </p>
