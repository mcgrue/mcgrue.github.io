This week&#8217;s advancements in the field of gruedorfery mainly lie in the iPhone side of things for me. Rusty and I creep ever closer to the end goal of shipping an iPhone game. We&#8217;re working, if it&#8217;s not clear, upon a [sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) clone to start with, and will progress to add features to our engine with progressively more complex games.

Of course, this may all be in vain if a verge 3 port to the iPhone comes out. Not that I&#8217;m one to start rumors&#8230;

### Gruedorf turns one, starts teething.

This marks the first anniversary of my <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/boards/display_thread.php?id=131619>first gruedorf post</a>, when a humble Grue and a pompous <a href=http://www.gearleaf.com/>Dorf</a> first shut up, threw down, then started swaking again. 

It amuses me to see that since it&#8217;s inception, <a href=http://www.johnweng.com/gruedorf/>twenty competitors have joined our unwinnable contest</a>. As of this writing, 6 are in a state of &#8220;not losing&#8221;, 10 are in a state of &#8220;losing&#8221;, and 4 have defunct sites. All in all, the contest is serving some of it&#8217;s purpose, keeping some chatter and activity constantly going, but I&#8217;d like to see it grow in the next year.

I&#8217;d also like to see <a href=http://www.bananattack.com/blog/>Overkill</a> and <a href=http://stickninja.wordpress.com/>Toen</a> stop failing so much, since both have made pretty awesome things in times past.

### What is Gruedorf again?

Gruedorf is a simple contest between myself (McGrue) and Kildorf designed to promote activity in the amateur game creation community over at <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com>www.verge-rpg.com</a>. 

There are but two rules:

  1. If you do an hour of work on a game and post to an RSS-enabled blog about it, you are not-losing. 
      * If you fail to do work and post about it, you are losing. </ol> 
        It is important to note that nobody can win Gruedorf. It sure is nice when you ship a game, but doing so doesn&#8217;t free you from the eternal geas of a minimum of one hour per week. After all, we are people who profess to enjoying development.
        
        ### So what got done this year?
        
        I&#8217;ve lost a few times, but kept up a whole bunch of progress.
