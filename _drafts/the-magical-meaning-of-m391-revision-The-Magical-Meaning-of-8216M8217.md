  <p>
    Apologies for the delays in posting.  It&#8217;s been a crazy year so far.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the last 10 days of 2008, there was a <a href="http://www.verge-rpg.com/boards/display_thread.php?id=132605">HoV contest at verge-rpg.com</a>.  Some of the mightiest hearts and minds in all of vergedom conglomerated to form a game the likes of which have totally been seen before but that they wanted to make nonetheless.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We came up with: <a href="../files/gruedorf_challenge/060/Dial%20%27M%27%20for%20MacGuffin.zip">Dial &#8216;M&#8217; for MacGuffin</a>, a Zelda-style top-down action adventure game which pits the mettle of a Dashing Chap (you) against the evil Lord Malefact, who has locked the doors of the whole village just before teatime.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.verge-rpg.com/boards/display_thread.php?id=132670">We lost</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some would blame a world not ready for such a bold new form of art.  Some would blame the lack of even a single boss fight.  Some would blame the shoddy hit model for attacking.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In the end, I blame the fact that <a href="http://ziniz.music.googlepages.com/mademoiselle.zip">CrazyAsianGamer made a helluva good game on his own</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Well, that, and the fact that my arch-nemesis Kildorf was the head Judge.
