**Mission Date:** 0 years, 250 days

On Day 0, it was 93%. At the time of our first flyby, it had been downgraded to 86%. By the time of our second flyby, during the one day window where live communication was possible with the Earth, the official number was 83% . Today a story ran that we&#8217;d been downgraded to 67%. These are the findings of the UN Astrophysics Lab, estimating the probability that Alpha Centauri&#8217;s fourth planet is habitable.

And we&#8217;re talking about a very low standard for habitability. Habitable, in their definition, means that landing makes more sense than just staying in space.

No need to worry about this. Perhaps during the moments of clarity that will hopefully punctuate my senility, I&#8217;ll hear our descendants arguing about whether or not they should focus on refining fuel for the journey home. I&#8217;m not sure why they would, except in the hope that their own senility will be punctuated by different arguments by their own ungrateful descendants. What those arguments will be, 160 years from now, we can only speculate about. They&#8217;ll have to reintegrate into Earth&#8217;s population after (minimum) 160 years of relative isolation, a possible source of anxiety and strife to be sure. Maybe they&#8217;ll have founded a new idiotic religion. Maybe I&#8217;ll be a central figure in it. Maybe these writings will be their foundational text. Whatever, nothing punctuates oblivion. Do you hear that, idiots? It&#8217;s not a metaphor. Your worship of me is ridiculous. Lets see a religion survive an ironclad record of a prophet saying _that__. _

It&#8217;s dark outside and getting darker. That one is a metaphor, jerks.
