  <strong>AJ</strong><br /> In species that have cloacas, do the males have cloacas too?
</p>

**Jesse**  
Yes.

**Jesse**  
It&#8217;s all cloacas, all the time.

**AJ**  
So do they pee out of the cloaca or the penis.

**Jesse**  
No.

**Jesse**  
What?

**Jesse**  
They have a cloaca, not a penis.

**AJ**  
They don&#8217;t have a penis at all? Huh.

**AJ**  
That must complicate the docking procedure.

**Jesse**  
Cloacal kiss!

**AJ**  
That sounds like a hentai.

**Jesse**  
&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca" target="_blank">Birds also reproduce with this organ; this is known as a cloacal kiss. Birds that mate using this method touch their cloacae for a only a few seconds, sufficient enough time for sperm to be transferred from the male to the female.</a>&#8221;

**Jesse**  
Birds don&#8217;t have problems with premature ejaculation.

**Jesse**  
They fucking pride themselves on it.
