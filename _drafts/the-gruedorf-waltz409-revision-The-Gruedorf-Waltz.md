Unfortunately I&#8217;ve been busy again, so I let my obligation slip by a day.  It&#8217;s been odd because I&#8217;m not sleeping in my house (due to Dethmöld) which has been making me feel a _whole_ lot better.  But it is impacting quality time with my computer!

After Hypnogourd (the original SotS musician from 1997, and my ol&#8217; highschool chum) dropped by [www.verge-rpg.com](http://www.verge-rpg.com) recently and said, unequivocably, that it was dead.  I tried to convince him that the google analytics said it wasn&#8217;t dead, just untalkative due to the site needing maintenence, but he wouldn&#8217;t hear it.

So I sent him to [www.tigsource.com](http://www.tigsource.com) to find conversation and brooded for three minutes before re-taking the [beta.verge-rpg.com](http://beta.verge-rpg.com) coding mantle again.

My plan is as follows:

  * Finish up Forums
  * Recode a robust upload/download system as fast as possible.
  * import the existing docs system from the existing vrpg
  * release.

This week I&#8217;ve:

  * tightened up url-rewriting.
  * Converted everything to [mysql\_real\_escape_string()](http://php.net/mysql_real_escape_string)
  * made sure editing posts wouldn&#8217;t double all newlines.
  * made sure editing posts wouldn&#8217;t double all slashes.
  * resolved testing issues that made beta.verge-rpg.com not agree with my local sandbox
  * set up things to assist [Overkill](http://www.bananattack.com/blog/) in getting beta.verge-rpg.com&#8217;s codebase to run on his local sandbox.
