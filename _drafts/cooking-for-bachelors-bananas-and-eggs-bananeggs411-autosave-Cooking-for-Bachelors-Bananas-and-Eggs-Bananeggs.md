excerpt: |
  Most of my cooking these days sticks to a very, very simple pattern: cut fresh stuff up, mix it up, and optionally cook it.  It's a simple process which lends itself to experimentation.  You're hungry, you raid the icebox to see what's in there, you pick a combination of elements and roll the dice.  If you win, it's delicious.
  
  And sometimes you hit the jackpot.

I&#8217;m a single, straight dude (and that&#8217;s the story I&#8217;m sticking to). As such, I have certain stereotypes I have to uphold. My apartment has to be messy, my outfits need to be uncoordinated, and my cooking needs to be simplistic.

But simple doesn&#8217;t need to mean &#8220;out of a box&#8221;.

Most of my cooking these days sticks to a very, very simple pattern: cut fresh stuff up, mix it up, and optionally cook it. It&#8217;s a simple process which lends itself to experimentation. You&#8217;re hungry, you raid the icebox to see what&#8217;s in there, you pick a combination of elements and roll the dice. If you win, it&#8217;s delicious.

And sometimes you hit the jackpot.

This one I wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve thought of normally, but I was all out of omlette fixins&#8217; (bell peppers, red onions, jalapeños, etc.), and I hate plain eggs. So I grabbed a banana off of my banana rack (because they were starting to go bad and their ranks needed much thinning) and mixed it into the eggs.

It was delicious.

It was _fucking_ delicious.

And it&#8217;s so goddamned _simple_.

I hadn&#8217;t ever heard of anyone doing this and I&#8217;ve had a few breakfasts in my day, yessiree. It&#8217;s so simple that it hardly needs instruction, and it&#8217;s [certainly been done before](http://www.mrbreakfast.com/superdisplay.asp?recipeid=1654), but whenever I look at recipes I generally find them lacking, so here&#8217;s the illustrated guide to the breakfastgasm:

        You may also want to butter the skillet at this time. I generally turn the heating element to high and give it 4-5 minutes to heat up the pan before cooking.

The bottom layer will already start to be browned, and the only way to prevent this from all going downhill quickly is to keep the eggs moving.

        You will shortly be rewarded with the light scent of bananas as the moisture from them escapes while they cook.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This really isn&#8217;t the hardest of foods to make.

        <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 250%;">7.</span> In about 2-3 minutes, depending on how well cooked you like them, your eggs will be ready! Move the skillet from the heating element, and scrape the eggs onto a plate! Stick a fork into them, for they are done.</div> 
        
        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 250%;">8.</span>Om nom nom.</div>

          The results are a moist (but not soggy), lightly sweetened pile of scrambled eggs. I&#8217;ve tried this simple dish with and without butter, and as an omlette. I prefer the scrambled, butterless preparation, myself.

          As an aside, I&#8217;m beginning to think that Bananas might be my favorite fruit. They&#8217;re versitile and have a subtle flavor that seems to be applicable to many culinareas. The awesomeness of the bananas I know make me mourn the fact that they are a strictly inferior breed to <a href="http://flexistentialist.org/blog/archives/2008/02/25/disappearing-bananas">the bananas that used to be</a>.
