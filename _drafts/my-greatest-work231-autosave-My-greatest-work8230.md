Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty much all downhill from here&#8230;

I had this as my gtalk status line for a while, too.  A co-worker was a bit apprehensive that I&#8217;d have the insensitivity to use &#8220;Hitler&#8221; in anything remotely visible and associated with me from work.  This confused me on several levels, since this wasn&#8217;t exactly &#8220;Wow, Hilter was a swell, upstanding citizen,&#8221; and for the fact that, well, as an engineering-heavy organization, far, _far_ worse things exist in our codebase.

I have yet to meet a codebase that didn&#8217;t have colorful language in comments, variable names, and commit messages.  Sailors have a thing or two to learn from engineers!
