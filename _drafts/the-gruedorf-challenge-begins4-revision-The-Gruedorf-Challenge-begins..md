They&#8217;re tedious to play through and slow down development. I&#8217;ve left in the old Castle Alden that&#8217;s never been used officially since it&#8217;s probably getting redone in about 1/8th the totaly area. At any rate, feel free to wander around the Aldencia Castle that never will be. Also, the observant will notice that this is running off of a Sully codebase with some very minor alterations (mainly to the textbox&#8217;s layout parameters), and with a few interesting additions to the new ./vc/sots/ directory. The underlying idea behind those files, should you look, is that there&#8217;ll be a &#8220;library&#8221; function where you can review any book you&#8217;ve read in-game in your menu, and see your book completion numbers for an area. It&#8217;s the little, stupid, things that make this fun for me.

### The babyfaced prince gets even cuter&#8230; maybe

I&#8217;m still on the wall about this one because I don&#8217;t plan on remaking all of the tilesets, and because I still haven&#8217;t worked out a clean version of the animation that I&#8217;m pleased with. Here&#8217;s a look at the new vs old.

### Excuses, excuses.

I&#8217;m going to be a little slow at first because I&#8217;m very interested in making some better dev tools than the ones at my disposal. I&#8217;m very interested in <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/boards/display_thread.php?next=1&id=131550>Ioachim&#8217;s platform agnostic maped</a>, as well as [other primitive web-based solutions](http://www.favicon.cc/). I&#8217;m also finishing up <a href=http://breadbros.com>Breadbrother&#8217;s new website</a> (not up as of this writing), so I won&#8217;t be dumping massive amounts of time into this challenge for a bit.

### Oh, right&#8230;

<a href=/files/gruedorf\_challenge/001/sots\_2007-10-14_001.rar>Here&#8217;s the insanely delayed 4th SotS demo!</a> Notice how it has less game than the third, the only interaction you have is with stairs, doors, and bookcases, and if you leave the castle it unceremoniously crashes! Enjoy!
