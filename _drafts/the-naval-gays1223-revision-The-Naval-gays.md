(If it was not a parent already this entire blog post was done via voice to text recognition .) 

( except for formatting) 

several years ago my friend Timothy fritz created a blog Pact: our mission to make a blog post 1 today and or die trying.

Joe Maphis won the previous bog packed because he lasted the longest.
