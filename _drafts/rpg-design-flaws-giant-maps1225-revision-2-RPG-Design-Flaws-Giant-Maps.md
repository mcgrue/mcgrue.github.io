As a member of the verge-rpg.com community since 1997, I&#8217;ve seen over 15 years of failed RPGs, and very, very rough demos. I intend on cataloging a list of RPG antipatterns to try and build up a set of good design principles.

The most common flaw I&#8217;ve seen, by far, is to make giant areas.

Be it because they&#8217;re using defaults in map editors (I&#8217;ve seen a few use 100&#215;100 as the standard) or because of the common mistake that [bigger is better](http://www.egometry.com/gruedorf/bigger-better-more-and-the-rpg-curse/), large areas seem to be the first, and perhaps the most critical, failing of a nascent RPG.

## Big Zones Are Boring

One of the two big draws in an RPG for me is Exploration. In fact, it&#8217;s my favorite part. And I love the occasional large area to explore&#8230; but any single zone of exploration that is enormous quickly gets tedious to explore.

Simply put: large, empty areas are boring, and I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of amateur RPGs that have this &#8220;feature&#8221;.

When designing a game, I find a useful guide to be to think in terms of single screens. Every distinct screen of game should have something new and interesting on it. Zelda is particularly inspirational here: each screen of Zelda had something specific and interesting to discover and explore.

## Big Zones are Tedious

Even if you manage to make every screen of an area unique, you can still screw it up by putting too much stuff to explore, or too repetitive of a thing to explore. 

There is a certain type of player who wants to do see everything and play with everything, and if you present too much, they&#8217;ll get bored with repetition in a single area.

For example, in my very first RPG, Saga of the Stars, I knew going in that I loved to read books in RPGs.

## Too Much Work

## Doing Big Right

It&#8217;s important to note that I&#8217;m not talking about large zones in (most) professional shipped RPGs, because they tend to do this right. The largest &#8220;Big Zone&#8221; in an RPG I can think of is FF7&#8217;s sprawling Midgar, which was so enormous that by the 15th hour I didn&#8217;t think there was going to be a game world. However, this area didn&#8217;t trigger the boring or repetitive sensors because it was actually a series of different zones that was turned into a large region.

Continuous areas made of of smaller, well-designed areas are much more fun.
