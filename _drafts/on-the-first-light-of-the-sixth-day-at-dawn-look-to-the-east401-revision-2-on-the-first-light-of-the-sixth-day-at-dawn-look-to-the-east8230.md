I am back.Â  The hands on the ol&#8217; <a href=http://www.johnweng.com/gruedorf/>gruedorf aggregator</a> say I&#8217;m 6 days and nearly 17 hours late.

Whoops.

Let&#8217;s commemorate my return with a little project centered around the reason for my delinquency!

### Girlfriend-kissing Countdown Google Gadget!<figure id="attachment_402" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption alignright">

Today&#8217;s bundle of joy is a Google Gadget that counts down the seconds until the next time my adorable and talented girlfriend and I meet. We&#8217;re on opposite coasts, she and I, and so we only get to fly to see each other every other weekend or so. 

I forget if this widget was her idea or mine, but she contributed the artings and I contributed the codings. And here it is! And it&#8217;s even installed on my wubsite for you to see if I&#8217;m having makeouts right now or merely waiting pensively for makeouts!

For those of you looking to take a gander at the source, <a href=http://www.sheisept.com/gaywidget/w/gaywidget.xml>http://www.sheisept.com/gaywidget/w/gaywidget.xml</a> is where you&#8217;ll find the code. It&#8217;s a work in progress, and it presently seems to break on IE, disappointingly. Even more disappointingly, it&#8217;s swallowing the errors so that <a href=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=2F465BE0-94FD-4569-B3C4-DFFDF19CCD99&displaylang=en>Microsoft Script Debugger</a> cannot catch them thereby illuminating me.

### Other Happenings

In addition to this, I&#8217;ve been busy teaching the girl the unix. 

That&#8217;s right. After I got her in the sack I got her in the console. Once you go black (with green text) you never go back.

I also bought her her first domain name, because that is a thing I do. I need to go to Registrar&#8217;s Anonymous soon. 

Hmmm&#8230; <a href=registrarsanonymous>registrarsanonymous.com</a> is available&#8230;

Anyway, after an hour-long tutorial she produced this: <figure id="attachment_404" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignright">[<img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/01/gruedorf-2009-01-25_0___hol-300x240.png" alt="Internets!" title="gruedorf-2009-01-25_0___hol" width="300" height="240" class="size-medium wp-image-404" />](http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/01/gruedorf-2009-01-25_0___hol.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Internets!</figcaption></figure>

And within minutes of that groundbreaking session, she went on to change her prototyped page via some putty and winscp fu into&#8230; <figure id="attachment_405" style="width: 294px" class="wp-caption alignleft">[<img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/01/gruedorf-2009-01-25_2___aww-294x300.png" alt="This totally beats the little hardhat guy." title="gruedorf-2009-01-25_2___aww" width="294" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-405" />](http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/01/gruedorf-2009-01-25_2___aww.png)<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This totally beats the little hardhat guy.</figcaption></figure>
