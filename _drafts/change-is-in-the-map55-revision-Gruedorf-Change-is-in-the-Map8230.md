### Gruedorf: Change is in the Map&#8230;

This week&#8217;s changes are mainly to the Crux Map-editor I posted last week. This week brings a bunch of refactorings, culminating in a much cleaner, quicker editing experience. Pending is some meta-data editing and a vsp view, but if you want to add more tiles for the meantime just add 32&#215;32 pngs to the tiles directory in the established naming pattern and you&#8217;re all set.

Also along with tonight&#8217;s speed-up refactoring comes the possibility of a full v3 multilayer application built on top of this in the future. The slowdown that prevented this from happening was caused by a juvenile mistake that Kael caught after a half hour of me debugging and him playing videogames while aen looked on.

(It&#8217;s easier to &#8220;pair&#8221; program when it&#8217;s being projected on a wall and everyone involved is several feet from each other. It&#8217;s amazing how much being in comfy chairs and not having your personal space infringed upon helps.)

Anyway, for all of you out there in TV land who care, [here&#8217;s the updated editor](http://www.egometry.com/egometry/webroot/files/gruedorf_challenge/047/cruxed_02.rar). CTRL-S also saves a .plist of the current map out into the v3.log, although the load doesn&#8217;t work yet. So sad.
