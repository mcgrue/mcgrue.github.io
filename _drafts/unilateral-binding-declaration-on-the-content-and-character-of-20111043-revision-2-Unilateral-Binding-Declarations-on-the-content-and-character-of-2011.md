**PREAMBLE:** 

Following is a Unilateral binding declaration on the content and character of 2011, hereafter referred to as the &#8220;New Year&#8221;.

Whereas 2010 was a pretty good year, marked by personal and professional growth,

Whereas the conference SIGGRAPH was attended by self for the first time,

Whereas hobbies in 2010 were particularly fruitful, with photography becoming part of my job,

Whereas several ambitious and fruitful professional projects were attempted professionally, including learning Houdini, teaching the Linear Workflow, and learning and teaching Arnold,

Be it hereby resolved that 2010 is a tough act to follow.

Notwithstanding, the content and character of the New Year will adhere to the following.

**Article 1: Whereas my photography skills have gotten pretty freaking good,**

Whereas 1x is the best photography on the web,

Whereas there are some photos on 1x that sort of suck, notwithstanding that those are few and far between

Be it hereby resolved that in the Near Year 2011 a photo authored by self will be published on 1x.

**Article 2: Whereas the Linear Workflow has already been nearly universally adopted at work,**

Whereas a second Linear Lecture is already planned for early in the New Year,

Whereas AO is still overused and RGB Light passes are still useless and slow to render,

Whereas the alternative is universally and unambiguously better,

Whereas the advantages of using a LUT workflow have been explained and demonstrated with projects such as LG,

Whereas this workflow has not been implemented on any projects since despite interest in it,

Be it hereby resovled that the New Year will see another marked improvement in our lighting and rendering processes.

**Article 3:** **Whereas all but the very best television programs are a total waste of time,**

Whereas time is the stuff life is made of, and time saved is an effective increase in life,

Whereas 2010 saw a small decrease in the number of television shows followed,

Whereas many of the remaining programs are far past their prime and are no longer worth watching,

Be it hereby resolved the number of TV shows followed in the new year will see another decline.

**Article 4:** **Whereas Moore&#8217;s law makes it inevitable that Unbiased Stochastic Path Tracing is future of 3D rendering,**

Whereas Arnold is the most capable unbiased Path Tracer currently available,

Whereas there is a conspicuous derth of Arnold shaders,

Whereas Arnold is still fairly exclusive,

Whereas I have been learning linear algebra but still possess little if any calculus,

Whereas I have no programming skills to speak of beyond scripting,

Be it hereby resolved in 2011 I will aqquire the prerequisite math and programming knowledge sufficient and write an Arnold shader used in production.

**Article 5:** **Whereas I&#8217;ve played poker successfully in the past  
** 

 ****Whereas it turns out there&#8217;s a weekly game at work for a few months now that I somehow didn&#8217;t even know about,

Whereas I don&#8217;t partake in enough social activities especially ones with coworkers as my lack of knowledge of this weekly game partially indicates,

Be it hereby resolved that I will take part in more social activities with coworkers in 2011, starting with the weekly poker game.

**Article 6:**  ****
