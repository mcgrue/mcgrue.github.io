So, I&#8217;ve been digging through a <a href=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/dor/objects/34260/watchmen/videos/watchmen\_gibbons\_071008.html target=_blank>few watchmen videos</a> from a few places, and there&#8217;s one thing in common:

They all have survival horror video game ads in front.

<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen target=_blank>Watchmen</a> is an award-winning comic book of the same vintage as The Dark Knight Returns and Maus. These are the books that _gave birth_ to the term Graphic Novel. 

And the advertisers associate slasher games with it?

I suppose the movie is targeted at a young male demographic because it&#8217;s a superhero flick, but the source material doesn&#8217;t really seem to lend itself to being fully appreciated by the set. 

On the other hand, who doesn&#8217;t love zombies?<div align=center>

In other news, this is egometry&#8217;s 100th post. And there were 100 words in this post before this footnote (quite unplanned).
