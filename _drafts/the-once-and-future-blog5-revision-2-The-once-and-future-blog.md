I&#8217;ve finally resurrected egometry.com. This here&#8217;s a rough custom shell of a site using the find framework from over at [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org). I&#8217;ve only been using their stuff for a week, and I have a bit yet to familiarize myself with, but it seems a fairly handy framework.

The trick, as with any framework, is familiarity.

I&#8217;ve mainly been learning cakePHP to finally finish <a href=http://breadbros.com/>Breadbros.com</a> in proper form. That&#8217;s progressing well, although I&#8217;ve now taken several days of diversion for this and/or recreating.

As is usually the case, moving environments from my dev box to the server here ran aground of mod_rewrite issues. However, I&#8217;m pretty sure the rewrites themselves are correct, and that the shortcomings are with my understanding of how cake handles it&#8217;s webroot. With time and tenacity will come understanding (then, death).

## The meat: Canadian Bacon

The main reason I&#8217;ve been pushing this through is the friendly little competition I find myself in with Mister <a href=http://speveril.northknight.com/about>Shamus &#8220;Kildorf&#8221; Peveril</a>. Ostensibly we&#8217;re both amatuer game-making enthusiasts, but in practice we&#8217;re mindblasted <a href=http://www.jonathancoulton.com/>code monkeys</a> who whine about &#8220;oh how wonderful it would be if we made games&#8221; and then don&#8217;t. Because not-doing something you want to do is the logical course of action.

So my challenge was as follows: we work on our respective games at least once a week, and post the WIP with the new work at least once a week on a blog with an RSS feed so we can keep easy tabs and make third party applications to mock each other later. Actually, I was hoping for a bit of WWF-style showmanship, but Kildorf&#8217;s a gentle soul who would claim to&#8217;ve helped your mom across the street, and nothing more.

A boy can dream of a theatrical scene-chewer arch-nemesis. A boy&#8230; can dream.

## assminr.com was taken

Also in other news, I&#8217;ve launched the emptyish shell of <a href=http://www.shitfuckr.com>an inside joke</a>. We are looking at the beginning of a _Social Shitfucking revolution_. This is bleeding edge here, folks.
