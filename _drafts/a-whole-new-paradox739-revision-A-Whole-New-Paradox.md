I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of Disney&#8217;s Aladdin this week for someone who&#8217;s pushing 30 and has no kids.  I rented the special edition and watched all of the comentary tracks.

Even though A Whole New World won the best song oscar for 1992, it&#8217;s not my favorite song by far from the movie (_One Jump Ahead_, _Prince Ali,_ and the _Prince Ali Reprise_ (the only time Jafar sings) are all clearly ahead).

The thing that always annoys me when the song comes up is in the following line:

_Unbelievable sights  
**Indescribable feeling**_

&#8230;You just described the feeling as indescribable! This feeling wasn&#8217;t as indescribable as first advertised, was it, Jasmine?

I really do wonder if this would&#8217;ve annoyed me before I&#8217;d read <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Godel,+Escher,+Bach" target=_blank>Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>, though.
