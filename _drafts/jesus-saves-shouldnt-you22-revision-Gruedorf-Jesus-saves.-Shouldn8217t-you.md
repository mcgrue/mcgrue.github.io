### Gruedorf: Jesus saves. Shouldn&#8217;t you?

<div style="float: right; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">

</div>

Annoyingly, I did the classic digital-age noob error around thursday. Namely: I didn&#8217;t save my work and blew it away. See, I was helping a friend of mine animate some stuff for her RPGMaker game (like the charming tit-squeezing victory animation you see here), and in my amusement I sorta killed my paint.net with an unsaved treatment of Erikk. C&#8217;est la vie.

But I made good on doing work of my own that actually got saved this week. <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/\_utils/roobarb/new\_erikk.gif>Here you can see a reconstructed Erikk in progress</a>. I am spending way too much time making his stylish red hat fully asymettrically awesome. Also, I&#8217;ve made his sprite 18 pixels wide to accomodate a properly wide brim. This is an experiment in the dark and might cause problems with map interaction later, but I&#8217;m willing to cross that bridge later.

### Back to the cute things that aren&#8217;t mine.

</div>

So here&#8217;s a sprite I made a two-frame animation out of from a single frame that&#8217;s not mine. It involves one of the simplest techniques you can possibly do to animate a sprite: grabbing a &#8220;connected&#8221; area (like head/hair, or shoulderpads/cape) and moving them a small amount for the second frame. It&#8217;s very simple, and it&#8217;s very effective.

### subversion advisory.

Please feel free, once again, to check out the current demo&#8217;s build over at <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/>http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/</a>.

Maybe by next week I&#8217;ll have a real internet connection. Maybe.
