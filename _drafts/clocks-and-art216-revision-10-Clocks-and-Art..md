        To the left you will find animated versions of the main character from Rusty Larner and my Sokoban clone for the iPhone. This is heavily, amazingly, tremendously inspired by a 16&#215;16 sprite named &#8220;bobo&#8221; made by <a href="http://jonwofford.com">Jon &#8220;evilbob&#8221; Wofford</a> back in the early v3 days. I gained his permission to derive a work from his, him stating that most anything from those days are now derilict.

      <p>
        I always remembered it because it was so simple in design.  The slightly-pissed-off, slightly-defeated blue orb.  I loved the eyes, and the way that the shading stayed in the same orientation no matter the view (showing that it was light shading on it&#8217;s orb body instead of any particular coloration).  I also like the lack of connection between the feet and the body and the eyes.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So I upgraded it from 16&#215;16 to 32&#215;32, but of note is that I actually preserved, without almost any alteration at all, the eyes and eyebrows from the original.  The rest of the sprite was redone for a native 32&#215;32 sprite.

        Anyways, the sprite is done. The game will shortly follow, now several weekends overdue from the original &#8220;deadline&#8221;.<br />

        So, last night I spent entirely setting up backups to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">amazon s3</a> for <a href="http://quistis.pi-r-squared.com/">this server</a> using <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2205967.html">Brad Fitzpatrick&#8217;s &#8220;Brackup&#8221;</a>. Actually, I killed a lot of time trying to use <a href="http://duplicity.nongnu.org/">duplicity</a>, but in the end debian&#8217;s apt-get defied me and I threw my hands into the air.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Anyway, at any time I could&#8217;ve made a gruedorf post, but I didn&#8217;t because my <a href="http://www.egometry.com/gruedorf/the-economicist-in-me/">Gruedorf Competition Widget</a> said I had 1 day, 2 hours left! So I was all &#8220;oh, cool!&#8221;, and went along with my system administration.

        Unfortunately, when I first built the first one, it wouldn&#8217;t auto-refresh. So I was looking at page results from the previous day, which was when I last hit the update button.

        Oops.

        Here&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.egometry.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/gruedorf-v3.widget">Updated Gruedorf Competition Widget</a>, which auto-updates every 15 minutes.
