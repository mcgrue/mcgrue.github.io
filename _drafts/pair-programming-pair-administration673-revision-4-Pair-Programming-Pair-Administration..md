### Pair Programming

I like pair programming<sup>1</sup>. 

However, long gone are the days where pairing benefits me personally to a great degree, educationally. These days my pair programming mainly keeps me on-task and away from the dread onset of <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html" target="_blank">Nerd ADD</a>, which is itself a Good Thing.

Being the clear Junior in a pair is generally my preferred position; I get to pair with someone who knows a field better than I do and devour their precious knowledge while (hopefully) providing a service to them by keeping them on task and helping to further cement and/or renew their understanding of the subject by taking a teaching role.

### Pair Administration

However<sup>3</sup>, when it comes to being a unix administrator, or even a unix shell user, whenever I pair with a peer<sup>2</sup> or better I learn new things. And I&#8217;ve been a unix user for over ten years and a (admittedly casual) server administrator for over 5 now.

Most commonly, these new pieces of unix and/or shell knowledge come from being the shotgun in a pair programming situation: The driver does some small bit of shell magic, I pull the breaks and ask them to explain what these new, wonderful shenanigans are. Sometimes they&#8217;re little things like using <b style="font-family: monospace;">!a</b> in bash to repeat the most recent command starting with &#8216;a&#8217;. Sometimes they&#8217;re the inner workings of a unix system like editing a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab target=_blank>fstab</a>.

Some things are necessary to manipulating a unix system. Turns out a lot of what you may personally take for granted isn&#8217;t actually in that category.

I&#8217;ve seen the same song and dance by observing others as well. Someone does some &#8216;voodoo&#8217;, and the other asks what they did. Knowledge is shared. It seems that unix administration is a lot like living in Manhattan; Local residents will often speak in a secret code exchanging Cartesian coordinates with each other proving that yes, they live here and, hey, maybe you&#8217;d appreciate the bagels at this intersection!

### Experience Matters!

The important thing to realize here, though, is the strides I see personally in pairing with administration are completely local. When I was a younger programmer, these information-exchange dances happened multiple times daily. I&#8217;ve just become too jaded to see them in my day-to-day operations, because they&#8217;re (usually) part of the standard mode of operations. Anything wildly different from my current problems and/or skill sets in software engineer that I hear generally gets discarded as irrelevant to my needs now. However, when I hear something similarly esoteric in a subject I am less close to, I&#8217;m all ears: This tidbit sounds interesting, and I should devote my brain to it.

Context is important. The obvious can seem awesome from a certain point of view, and the awesome can seem obvious!

### Always Two There Are&#8230;

When you pair, there&#8217;s generally a tutor/tutee dynamic going on. The more unknown there is, the more &#8220;magical&#8221; it feels, and the more you appreciate sopping up all that new delicious knowledge. The closer you get to putting your <a href=http://abundance-blog.marelisa-online.com/2008/11/17/outliers-10000-hours-for-success/ target=_blank>magical 10,000th hour</a> into something, the fewer &#8216;new&#8217; things you see (or recognize as pertinent).

The important thing, it turns out, is not to dwell on the magical learning revelation sensation. Being the bottom of a pair may feel more &#8220;learny&#8221;, but being the top is no less good for you. As opposed to &#8220;learny&#8221; you get &#8220;cementy&#8221;, &#8220;practicey&#8221;, and &#8220;teachey&#8221;. 

And sometimes you get to learn a thing or two, too.

That pairing can work for things other than programming shouldn&#8217;t surprise anyone, and the fact that pair programming is effective should not be controversial. Pairing is, essentially, a single teacher to single student situation. A master and an apprentice, who can switch roles at a moment&#8217;s notice.

  <sup>1</sup> &#8230;Usually. It only works when your pair is being interactive. If a partner is non-communicative, the exercise fails. This can be caused by a driver charging ahead without narrating or responding to questions, or a shotgun falling into torpor and not asking questions.

  <sup>2</sup> Heh. Peer Pairing.<br /> If you like to pair with superiors, you need to parry peer pairing; but you won&#8217;t fair well and soon you may say farewell to your fare wellspring of employment. Do not fear peer paring; But do fear pear peeling. The pear peel is fair to the feel and swell for a meal.<br /> &#8230;I&#8217;ll stop now.

  <sup>3</sup> This is the exact point where I realized my original premise was flawed, and I tried to reconcile it. Had I more time, I think I&#8217;d revisit this whole essay from the ground up. I don&#8217;t like how the second half of this all goes, currently, but hey: that&#8217;s Blogdorf for you.<br /> &#8230;I&#8217;ll stop now.
