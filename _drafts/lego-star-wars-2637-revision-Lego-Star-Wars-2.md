On the strength of Yahtzee&#8217;s <a href=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/123-LEGO-Indy>You Might Enjoy Lego Indiana Jones</a> review, and the fact that I seem to have recalled hearing other people speak well of the Lego Star Wars games in the past, and (honestly) mostly the fact that I&#8217;ve started to become a bit of a Gamer Point whore, I decided to pick up Lego Star Wars 2 for my XBOX 360!

Oh, god it sucks.

#### Pro:

  * You get to beat the ever-loving fuck out of your allies.

#### Con:

  * Your allies get in the way far too easily, especially in co-op mode. 

#### Pro:

  * There&#8217;s an impressive amount of humor present, mostly of a slapstick/in-reference sort (Chewie can, for instance, pull the arms off of lego enemies as a melee attack.)

#### Con:

  * A lot of the expressions seem wrong to very wrong (I can&#8217;t rid of the impression that Lego Han Solo prowls Lego Elementary Schools for unsupecting Duplos to molest.)

#### Pro:

  * A lot of shit to blow up, and that shit drops delicious money that you can collect with seratonin-emitting ching-ghing sounds.

#### Con:

  * &#8230;but there seems to be no real point to collecting all of the money. Other than the high, that is.

#### Pro:

  * There are tons of meaningless collectable sets hidden within each of the sub-zones to find and make you feel rewarded when you procure them!

#### Con:

  * There are tons of _meaningless_ collectable sets.

#### Pro:

  * The camera isn&#8217;t user-controllable and totally sucks. **Oh wait, that&#8217;s not a pro at all**!

#### Con:

  * The game requires a large amount of platform jumping and is very finicky about edges. It&#8217;s the jumping puzzle of Xenogears but the _entire game_.

#### Pro:

  * You can almost rape each other against the wall in co-op&#8230;

#### Con:

  * &#8230;but it turns out the walls and/or characters are too well lubricated, as they slip off of one another (these two suggested by Sophia. Honest.). 

My recommendation: avoid the game.

&#8230;I will, of course, still play it just to get my goddamned gamer points, though.
