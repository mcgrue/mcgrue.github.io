A few weeks ago I installed Boot Camp on my 13&#8243; Macbook Pro. This was mainly to enjoy Civilization 5 while on vacation.

What ensued was 10+ hours of hell. Here are the high points:

  * You need the matching Macbook Pro OS X Install DVD to the hardware version you have. This is very frustrating because I had my girlfriend&#8217;s previous-generation 13&#8243; Macbook Pro disc, but couldn&#8217;t find my own.
  * Apple is retarded for not putting Bootcamp files on their website downloadable by all.
  * the 13&#8243; macbook pro didnt have a working sound jack even after running bootcamp. The sound drivers are at <http://www.cirrus.com/en/products/pro/detail/P1233.html>

The fun part is that my next-door neighbor had borrowed my Macbook Pro&#8217;s Install Disc a day or two before (nobody informed me). He&#8217;d done it to make a master image to avoid just this sort of hell. He was very sorry when he found out my plight. ;(
