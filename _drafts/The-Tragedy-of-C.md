Modern science tells us that neither information nor matter may ever exceed the speed of light. It seems as immutable rule as exists. The only workarounds posited rely on engineering or finding wormholes, and one seems unlikely and the other impossible. It&#8217;s pretty awesome and unreasonable that there exists a universal speed limit, but it also fucking SUCKS.

Seriously, what the hell, nature? When have you done this before? The universe was a playground, a cleverness factory, with no limits to what you can do if you&#8217;re smart enough. Oh, except there is no matter how well things go for us, there is no reason to expect any human to ever visit any other galaxy.

To realize how much this sucks, consider the fractal awesomeness of the universe. Nothing is ever simple, nature finds a way to incorporate detail at every scale to everything it has ever created, and always in surprising ways. We have not yet found an object in our solar system that doesn&#8217;t show you something awesome if you point a camera at it break it open.

Why should the pinpricks of light in the sky be any different? Well you&#8217;ll never find out any neither will anyone else. 100% of the universe is off limits and always will be.
