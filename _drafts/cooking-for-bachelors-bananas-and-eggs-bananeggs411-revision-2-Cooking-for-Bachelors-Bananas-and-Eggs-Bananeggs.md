I&#8217;m a single, straight dude (and that&#8217;s the story I&#8217;m sticking to). As such, I have certain stereotypes I have to uphold. My apartment has to be messy, my outfits need to be uncoordinated, and my cooking needs to be simplistic.

But simple doesn&#8217;t need to mean &#8220;out of a box&#8221;.

Most of my cooking these days sticks to a very, very simple pattern: cut fresh stuff up, mix it up, and optionally cook it. It&#8217;s a simple process which lends itself to experimentation. You&#8217;re hungry, you raid the icebox to see what&#8217;s in there, you pick a combination of elements and roll the dice. If you win, it&#8217;s delicious.

And sometimes you hit the jackpot.
