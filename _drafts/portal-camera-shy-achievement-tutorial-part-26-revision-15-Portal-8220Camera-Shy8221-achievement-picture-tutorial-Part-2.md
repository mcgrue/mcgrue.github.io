Welcome back to the visual tutorial for where all of the cameras that you can destrol in in Valve&#8217;s new Portal game are. This is the second (of two) parts and the <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>first one</a> can be found <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>by clicking here</a>.

Note that the photo essay thing here is mainly for &#8220;that one effing camera&#8221; you can&#8217;t find. Really, just knowing how many cameras you should find on each level is enough to get anyone through to completetion on this Achievement, and you can find that list at the top of <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>part one of this tutorial</a>.

Enough chitchat. Let&#8217;s break some cameras.

### Level 10

<a title="After 4 brief, empty levels devoid of any form of cameras, Valve rewards us for our patience by putting one right in plain view." href="/i/13/full/10_30_twelfth_camera_1.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/10_30_twelfth_camera_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

After 4 brief, empty levels devoid of any form of cameras, Valve rewards us for our patience by putting one right in plain view.

<a title="ETHNIC_TERM_FOR_GOODBYE_HERE, sucker.  You have chosen ARRIVEDERCI.  To confirm this selection, press ONE." href="/i/13/full/10_31_twelfth_camera_dead.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/10_31_twelfth_camera_dead.jpg" alt="" /></a>

ETHNIC\_TERM\_FOR\_GOODBYE\_HERE, sucker.

You have chosen ARRIVEDERCI. To confirm this selection, press ONE.

### Level 11

<a title="The one camera on this level is a tricky one. I actually missed it the first time this go-round, and had to restart from level 05. Of course, that was a 8 minute diversion, so no big loss.**Lesson learned**: _always turn around_.&#8221; href=&#8221;/i/13/full/11\_34\_thirteenth\_camera\_1.jpg&#8221; rel=&#8221;lightbox[portal2]&#8221;>![](/i/13/thumb/11_34_thirteenth_camera_1.jpg)</a>

The one camera on this level is a tricky one. I actually missed it the first time this go-round, and had to restart from level 05. Of course, that was a 8 minute diversion, so no big loss.

**Lesson learned**: _always turn around_.

<a title="There.  Now let's go get the goods." href="/i/13/full/11_35_thirteenth_camera_dead.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/11_35_thirteenth_camera_dead.jpg" alt="" /></a>

There. Now let&#8217;s go get the goods.

<a title="Oh yeah.  Now you're playing with power.  PORTAL power." href="/i/13/full/11_33_orange_gun.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/11_33_orange_gun.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Oh yeah. Now you&#8217;re playing with power. PORTAL power.

<a title='We will now pause to do the obligatory "playing with Portals Physics" things. I like this one because a third party observer would see you cut in half with each half looking at each other.' href="/i/13/full/11_36_portals_foolin_1.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/11_36_portals_foolin_1.jpg" alt="" /></a>

We will now pause to do the obligatory &#8220;playing with Portals Physics&#8221; things.

I like this one because a third party observer would see you cut in half with each half looking at each other.

<a title="Checking out your own ass is the least naughty thing I'd do had I my own portable wormhole generator." href="/i/13/full/11_37_portals_foolin_2.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/11_37_portals_foolin_2.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Checking out your own ass is the least naughty thing I&#8217;d do had I my own portable wormhole generator.

<a title="And as a bonus strategy guide, here's the tutorial for getting the Terminal Velocity achievement." href="/i/13/full/11_38_portals_foolin_3.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/11_38_portals_foolin_3.jpg" alt="" /></a>

And as a bonus strategy guide, here&#8217;s the tutorial for getting the Terminal Velocity achievement.

<a title="Licking my own feet while not bending over is the second least naughty thing I'd do had I my own portable wormhole generator." href="/i/13/full/11_38_portals_foolin_5.jpg" rel="lightbox[portal2]"><img src="/i/13/thumb/11_38_portals_foolin_5.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Licking my own feet while not bending over is the second least naughty thing I&#8217;d do had I my own portable wormhole generator.
