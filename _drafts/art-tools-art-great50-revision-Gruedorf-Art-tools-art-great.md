### iPhone Development: project Crux

This week I worked some with Rusty on the iPhone tile engine: we now have full maploading and zooming. yay!

I also worked some on a mapeditor. The mapeditor is a verge game right now, because the maps are simple and I wanted an editor mac and pc users both could use. I&#8217;ll post that when it&#8217;s a little further along.

### SpriteWright.com

The biggest thing I&#8217;ve worked on this week is [spritewright.com](http://www.spritewright.com/). I&#8217;ve been wanting to work on a javascript-only tile/sprite editing tool for a long time now (I really don&#8217;t know why: blame derangement if you must), and I finally just started tapping it out. It&#8217;s served pretty well to cement my love and understanding of the YUI and of event-driven programming. Thusfar this has been a non-TDD spike, but it&#8217;s almost too big now to go without tests. I certainly need to get my house in order before implementing a full undo/redo stack, for instance.

### Future Plans

I&#8217;d like to eventually have a full database of public tiles and sprites up on SpriteWright, indexed and sortable by tag (omg, the icons of snozzberries are tagged &#8216;snozzberries&#8217;!) and/or by what palette was used. In fact, my obsession with palettes and palette-based art manipulation was half of the reason behind this whole thing.

I&#8217;d also like to add an open API so other art programs could load and save to the service. That&#8217;d be neat.

In the more distant but hopefully not-too-distant future I wouldn&#8217;t mind implementing a flash-driven web-based mapeditor that tied into the API, to solve once and for all the godforsaken verge cross-platform devtools problem (and to sharpen up my flex skills).

### A Crippling Addiction

So, I think <a href=http://spritewright.com>spritewright.com</a> is the official name, but I also registered <a href=http://spriteright.com>spriteright.com</a>, <a href=http://spriterite.com>spriterite.com</a>, and <a href=http://spritewrite.com>spritewrite.com</a>.

Clearly, I have a problem.

I like the implications of a craftsman that -wright implies, but I also like typing &#8216;spriterite&#8217; because you get to spell &#8216;rite&#8217; twice in a row. I got the others because if I&#8217;m ever pitching this site in the future verbally, I don&#8217;t want to have to spell it. I&#8217;ll just be all &#8220;Eh, it&#8217;s spelled how you think it is.&#8221; and let them get there anyway they think.
