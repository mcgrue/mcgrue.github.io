      So here&#8217;s some of the fancy shenanegans I&#8217;ve been up to lately with Gayo on Sully. I&#8217;ve been working on putting the render stack under test to hunt down some obscure bugs and mystery crashes, and that&#8217;s been going nicely. Lesson learned: FreeImage on a bad index is bad&#8230; so I augmented the verge3 engine to noisy-error in that circumstance: although we might eventually just want it to do a noop instead of doing a fragile error or doing a bad operation.

      I&#8217;ve also made a bit of progress on the <a href="http://beta.verge-rpg.com">http://beta.verge-rpog.com</a> site. I should work out a good stylesheet for the forums and be done with that major third of the site&#8230; although really I need to make the forum management UIs. Which are just two screens, as far as I can tell&#8230;

      Nothing&#8217;s been happening on the iPhone front in the last week. I&#8217;ve been sorta really busy at week getting <a href="http://www.imvu.com/music"></a>IMVU&#8217;s Music Portal whipped into shape. And shape has been whipped into it. So all is well now.
