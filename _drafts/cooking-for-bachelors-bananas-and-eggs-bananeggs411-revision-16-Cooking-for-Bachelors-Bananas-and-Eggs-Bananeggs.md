  Most of my cooking these days sticks to a very, very simple pattern: cut fresh stuff up, mix it up, and optionally cook it.  It's a simple process which lends itself to experimentation.  You're hungry, you raid the icebox to see what's in there, you pick a combination of elements and roll the dice.  If you win, it's delicious.
  
  And sometimes you hit the jackpot.

I&#8217;m a single, straight dude (and that&#8217;s the story I&#8217;m sticking to). As such, I have certain stereotypes I have to uphold. My apartment has to be messy, my outfits need to be uncoordinated, and my cooking needs to be simplistic.

But simple doesn&#8217;t need to mean &#8220;out of a box&#8221;.

Most of my cooking these days sticks to a very, very simple pattern: cut fresh stuff up, mix it up, and optionally cook it. It&#8217;s a simple process which lends itself to experimentation. You&#8217;re hungry, you raid the icebox to see what&#8217;s in there, you pick a combination of elements and roll the dice. If you win, it&#8217;s delicious.

And sometimes you hit the jackpot.

This one I wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve thought of normally, but I was all out of omlette fixins&#8217; (bell peppers, red onions, jalapeños, etc.), and I hate plain eggs. So I grabbed a banana off of my banana rack (because they were starting to go bad and their ranks needed much thinning) and mixed it into the eggs.

It was delicious.

It was _fucking_ delicious.

And it&#8217;s so goddamned _simple_.

I hadn&#8217;t ever heard of anyone doing this and I&#8217;ve had a few breakfasts in my day, yessiree. It&#8217;s so simple that it hardly needs instruction, and it&#8217;s [certainly been done before](http://www.mrbreakfast.com/superdisplay.asp?recipeid=1654), but whenever I look at recipes I generally find them lacking, so here&#8217;s the illustrated guide to the breakfastgasm:

### Bananas and Eggs

#### Ingredients:

3 Large eggs.  
1 Medium Banana, slightly overripe.

#### Steps:

  <figure id="attachment_415" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/01-that-shit-is-bananas.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/01-that-shit-is-bananas-150x150.jpg" alt="That shit is bananas" title="01-that-shit-is-bananas" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-415" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">That shit is bananas</figcaption></figure><br /> 1. First, make sure you have bananas! I&#8217;ve found that older bananas which are going a bit soft work best here. If you use fresher bananas, consider mashing them less finely for a chunky-style variant!

<div style="width: 580px;">
  <figure id="attachment_416" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/02-fruit-meet-thy-doom.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/02-fruit-meet-thy-doom-150x150.jpg" alt="Pestles make for masterful mashing!" title="02-fruit-meet-thy-doom" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-416" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Pestles make for masterful mashing!</figcaption></figure><br /> 2. I just bought an ikea <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_and_pestle>Mortar and Pestle</a> for mashing up things consistently. I was using forks and/or the bottoms of pilsner glasses before getting this, which worked well and gave the bananas a nice chunky consistency.<br /> <figure id="attachment_417" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/03-harry-chapin-tribute.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/03-harry-chapin-tribute-150x150.jpg" alt="Mashed bananas, fit for the most infantile of engineers..." title="03-harry-chapin-tribute" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-417" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mashed bananas, fit for the most infantile of engineers...</figcaption></figure><br /> However, I really wanted an excuse to buy a mortar and pestle&#8230;

<div style="width: 580px;">
  <figure id="attachment_418" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/04-match-made-in-heaven.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/04-match-made-in-heaven-150x150.jpg" alt="Oh yes.  Soon you will be together..." title="04-match-made-in-heaven" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-418" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Oh yes. Soon you will be together...</figcaption></figure><br /> 3. Right about now you should be turning on your stovetop and putting your skillet on it.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Oh, and you need a skillet and a stove for this whole operation&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You may also want to butter the skillet at this time. I generally turn the heating element to high and give it 4-5 minutes to heat up the pan before cooking.
  </p>
</div>

<div style="width: 580px;">
  <figure id="attachment_419" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/05-premixed.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/05-premixed-150x150.jpg" alt="Stirred eggs meet mashed bananas..." title="05-premixed" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-419" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Stirred eggs meet mashed bananas...</figcaption></figure><br /> 4. Whisk (or in my case, fork) the eggs together in a bowl, and once the eggs have an even consistency, dump the bananas in.
</div>

<div style="width: 580px;">
  <figure id="attachment_420" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/06-postmixed.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/06-postmixed-150x150.jpg" alt="The purest Purée." title="06-postmixed" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-420" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The purest Purée.</figcaption></figure><br /> 5. And then mix the <i>fuck</i> out of them.
</div>

<div style="width: 580px;">
  <figure id="attachment_421" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/07-into-the-frying-pan.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/07-into-the-frying-pan-150x150.jpg" alt="Almost done..." title="07-into-the-frying-pan" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-421" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Almost done...</figcaption></figure><br /> 6. Pour the mixture onto the skillet, and use a spatula to keep the mixture moving. At first the mixture will be very liquid, but be sure to move the spatula against the pan all the way around within the first 5-10 seconds. The bottom layer will already start to be browned, and the only way to prevent this from all going downhill quickly is to keep the eggs moving.</p> 
  
  <p>
    You will shortly be rewarded with the light scent of bananas as the moisture from them escapes while they cook.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This really isn&#8217;t the hardest of foods to make.
  </p>

<div style="width: 580px;">
  <figure id="attachment_422" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/08-omnomnom.jpg"><img src="http://www.egometry.com/i/2009/02/08-omnomnom-150x150.jpg" alt="This is so damned good.  <i>So</i>." title="08-omnomnom" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-422" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is so damned good. <i>So</i>.</figcaption></figure></p> 
  
  <p>
    7. In about 2-3 minutes, depending on how well cooked you like them, your eggs will be ready! Move the skillet from the heating element, and scrape the eggs onto a plate! Stick a fork into them, for they are done.
