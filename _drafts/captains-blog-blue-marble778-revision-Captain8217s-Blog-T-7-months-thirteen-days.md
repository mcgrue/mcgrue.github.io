We&#8217;ve hit a milestone today! Due to complex nature of gravitation slingshots, we&#8217;re passing earth for the second time today, more than half a year into our journey. Today&#8217;s flyby is much faster than the others. About half of the crew gathered in the observatory to watch it fly by over the course of about fifteen minutes or so. Truely a majestic sight, passing between the moon and earth. At these speeds you aren&#8217;t able to judge distances, the planet doesn&#8217;t feel any further away than a mountain on the highway.

Maybe I should get some introductory stuff out of the way. I&#8217;m the captain of a colony ship en route to Alpha Centauri. It should take roughly eighty years to get there, which makes this a generation ship. I, however, fully intend to still be alive when we arrive to bring humanity to the stars!

Aside from our last flyby, an odd thing happened today. About 15% of crew members called in sick, and another 10% simply didn&#8217;t show up for duty. Normally I&#8217;d be concerned about some sort of space-plague, but we have a sort of explaination: over the last two days, every last one of our escape pods have gone missing. When about half of them were gone, security was ordered to put the remaining pods under guard. Now all of the pods are missing, along with a disproportionately high number of security personell.

Oddly enough, none of this would have happened if anyone had read the memos. Our velocity in relation to the earth was very, very high. Far more than the delta-v the thrusters in an escape pod can achieve. This was in a crew wide communique, which apparently noone reads.

Leadership often raises difficult questions. I&#8217;m charged with keeping morale up, and I need to decide what to tell the crew about why our crew just shrank by about a quarter. Which would be worse for your morale, that a large number of your coworkers left, or that all of the escapees certainly died and the beautiful meteor shower you witnessed was thanks to their sacrifice? I&#8217;m really not sure.

Picard out.
