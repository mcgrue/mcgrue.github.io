This week&#8217;s gruedorf entry consists of:

  * Fixing a bug with deletion in McgRender Mark V (in sully).  This was requested by Gayo so he could make the battle intro/outro effects in the Sully battle system.  Yay!
  * Working on the edit post functionality at http://beta.verge-rpg.com as well as general message-centric fucntionality.  The awesome thing is that both my sandbox and vrpg agree on what tests pass and what tests fail.
  * Added a sprite animation system to the iPhone Sokoban game.  Rusty also implemented some pathfinding to add some superior UI tap-based movement into the game.  A d-pad is a bad idea for an iPhone game, as is a 1:1 gesture:movement ratio.  You don&#8217;t want to stroke your phone 12 times to move 12 tiles.  Honestly, even the iPhone isn&#8217;t sexy enough to warrant _that_ level of public fondling.
