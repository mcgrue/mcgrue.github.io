Brief post. At the office at the moment hacking on my hack week project. More than an hour of gruedorfing, however, has happened. Basically I hooked up and cleaned up a bunch of vc, so now jujube.map is connected to cave.map (the sand cave), and dwarf.map (the dwarf town).

Oh yeah. There&#8217;s a cave and dwarves in sully now. Who knew.

Anyways, go check it out at the <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/trunk/>svn repo</a> if you&#8217;d like. Username and password both &#8220;anonymous&#8221;, as usual.
