**Mission Date:** 0 years, 235 days

I&#8217;ve thought very hard about what needs to be done to save the morale on this ship. In fact this journal is being kept for partially the same purpose flight recorders are on airplanes. Consider this journal to be a psychological black box of the mission. This is not to say I&#8217;m not trying to save it, I am, but if that&#8217;s not in the cards I&#8217;d like future historians to have some idea of how this happened.

That said, I have no idea what to do and I&#8217;ve reached the point of near dispair. Not knowing what to do I decided to appeal to the crew, and ask them what should be done. I&#8217;ve gone to the time honored tradition of last resort, the stately suggestion box.

Most of the &#8220;suggestions&#8221; weren&#8217;t actually suggestions but detailed critiques of the concept or execution of a suggestion box. I&#8217;ll have to tell Dr. Saratoga to add &#8220;insufferable know-it-all&#8221; to the list of character flaws everyone on this ship seems to have. Apart from that, there were some serious suggestions, like having dances or cooking classes or getting-to-know-your-shipsmates events. All of the remaining suggestions were equally terrible, apart from one.

It was truely special. I have yet to tell someone about the idea and not see an insant smile appear on their faces. Sociologists giggle with glee. Engineers eyes widen and they start scribbling madly, trying to figure out how it could be possible. The most dreary face livens instantly, and lines dissapear from peoples faces.

I&#8217;m preparing my speech to the crew. The cry of the opressed spirit has an answer, and defiant reply is &#8220;Wednesdays we float&#8221;. The idea that will save the UNSS Ennui is &#8220;Zero Gravity Wednesdays&#8221;.
