<div style="text-align: center;">
  Jonas<br /> the chicken and egg is a stupid question<br /> they didn&#8217;t specify it was a chicken egg<br /> whatever evolved into a chicken laid eggs</p> 
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> oh, the egg came first<br /> right<br /> yeah<br /> but it&#8217;s allegorical
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> if you do specify it was a chicken egg then you have an egg with chicken DNA<br /> it&#8217;s still the egg<br /> since the mutation that crossed the line into being a chicken didn&#8217;t happen after the egg was laid
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias: what about things that lay eggs and eggs
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> thing that lays eggs<br /> evolution helps with that one too
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> right<br /> what about things that lay eggs and hatched from eggs, and eggs
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> eggs<br /> something that wasn&#8217;t hatched from an egg layed an egg for some arbitrary definition of &#8220;egg&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> what about things that lay eggs and hatched from eggs, and eggs that were laid by things that hatched from eggs
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> things that lay eggs and hatched from eggs<br /> you just moved it back a half generation<br /> I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a way to define the question that makes it unanswerable
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> well you could define a chicken as an animal that hatched from a chicken egg, and a chicken egg as an egg that was laid by a chicken<br /> now which one came first
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> alright lets see<br /> there&#8217;s no genetic diffence between the egg and whatever hatched from it<br /> so the first chicken egg came from a non-chicken
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> but thats not a chicken egg
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> ok a non-chicken laid a chicken-containing egg that was not a chicken egg<br /> the chicken containing egg hatched into a chicken
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> no, chickens only come from chicken eggs
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> oh right<br /> ok, non-chicken-bird laid a chicken-like-animal-containing egg<br /> &#8230;wait<br /> according to your definition there has never been and will never be a chicken
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> but there is, therefore god exists
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Jonas<br /> no even if god exists, he either made a chicken or an egg<br /> but that chicken wasn&#8217;t a chicken since it didn&#8217;t hatch from an egg<br /> so there still has never been and never will be a chicken
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Tobias<br /> he made a chicken that hatched from an egg it laid itself
  </p>
