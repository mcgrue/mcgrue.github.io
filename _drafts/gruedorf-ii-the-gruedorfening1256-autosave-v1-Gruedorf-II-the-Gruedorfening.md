Once upon a time, there was a competition between two folk.

&#8220;I would like to make a video game, but I am SOOOOO busy,&#8221; said folk one.

&#8220;I know! Me too! and also I&#8217;m better than you,&#8221; said folk two.

And so a grand fight started. Each agreed to post progress about their game once every seven days on a blog, and if they didn&#8217;t, they would lose. 

And one couldn&#8217;t win.

Those two folk, one &#8220;Grue&#8221; and one &#8220;Dorf&#8221; have been losing for quite a while now.

But a gauntlet has been thrown and the mantle has been raised once more. The mantle of maybe sucking a little less!

I&#8217;ve worked on Sully: A Very Serious RPG this week!

I&#8217;ve designed all of the Dungeon of Love levels!

Look, here&#8217;s the images:

Okay, 7 days until I lose!
