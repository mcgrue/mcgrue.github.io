### Pair Programming

I like pair programming<sup>1</sup>. 

However, long gone are the days where pairing benefits me personally to a great degree, educationally. These days my pair programming mainly keeps me on-task and away from the dread onset of <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html" target="_blank">Nerd ADD</a>, which is itself a Good Thing.

Being the clear Junior in a pair is generally my preferred position; I get to pair with someone who knows a field better than I do and devour their precious knowledge while (hopefully) providing a service to them by keeping them on task and helping to further cement and/or renew their understanding of the subject by taking a teaching role.

### Pair Administration

However, when it comes to being a unix administrator, or even a unix shell user, whenever I pair with a peer<sup>2</sup> or better I learn new things. And I&#8217;ve been a unix user for over ten years and a (admittedly casual) server administrator for over 5 now.

Most commonly, these new pieces of unix and/or shell knowledge come from being the shotgun in a pair programming situation: The driver does some small bit of shell magic, I pull the breaks and ask them to explain what these new, wonderful shenanigans are. Sometimes they&#8217;re little things like using <b style="font-family: monospace;">!a</b> in bash to repeat the most recent command starting with &#8216;a&#8217;. Sometimes they&#8217;re the inner workings of a unix system like editing a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fstab target=_blank>fstab</a>.

Some things are necessary to manipulating a unix system. Turns out a lot of what you may personally take for granted isn&#8217;t actually in that category.

I&#8217;ve seen the same song and dance by observing others as well. Someone does some &#8216;voodoo&#8217;, and the other asks what they did. Knowledge is shared. It seems that unix administration is a lot like living in Manhattan; Local residents will often speak in a secret code exchanging Cartesian coordinates with each other proving that yes, they live here and, hey, maybe you&#8217;d appreciate the bagels at this intersection!

This culture of <a href=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-mor1.htm target=_blank>multiple cat-skinning techniques</a> that surely inspired <a href=http://www.wall.org/~larry/ target=_blank>Larry Wall</a> saturates the core of admin culture. Occasionally I see programmers exchanging techniques with each other in a canine sniffing dance, but often I&#8217;ll see admin-types quiz each other as to &#8220;how could I do this thing I am doing differently&#8221;

  <sup>1</sup> &#8230;Usually. It only works when your pair is being interactive. If a partner is non-communicative, the exercise fails. This can be caused by a driver charging ahead without narrating or responding to questions, or a shotgun falling into torpor and not asking questions.

  <sup>2</sup> Heh. Peer Pairing.<br /> If you like to pair with superiors, you need to parry peer pairing; but you won&#8217;t fair well and soon you may say farewell to your fare wellspring of employment. Do not fear peer paring; But do fear pear peeling. The pear peel is fair to the feel and swell for a meal.<br /> &#8230;I&#8217;ll stop now.
