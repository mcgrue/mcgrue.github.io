</div>

Welcome to Valve&#8217;s awesome game: portal! This here&#8217;s my guide to getting the &#8220;Camera Shy&#8221; achievement. Because while I&#8217;m a egotist camwhore myself, I&#8217;m a flaming libertarian. Ergo, only cameras I like I like.

Before we begin: I&#8217;m not planning on really spoiling the story, but I don&#8217;t care enough to see that through. If you haven&#8217;t played it, why are you reading a guide to complete the final achievement?

Now, there are 33 cameras that you can destroy. There are a lot more that you can&#8217;t, but we don&#8217;t care about these immortal cameras. Only the ones that, much like a woman, make a satisfying sound as they fall helplessly to the ground.

As an aside, I thought it was rather awesome that all of the characters in this game were female (or simulacrums thereof). You don&#8217;t see that too often outside of Japanese lesbian dating simulators.

The cameras are distributed as follows:

Now, to the camera-carnage!

### Level 02

<a title="<p>Level 2 has 3 killable cameras.  But none of that matters until you git yer gun.  Second amendment forever!" rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_01_level_02.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_01_level_02_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Hanyways: Level 2 has 3 killable cameras. But none of that matters until you git yer gun. Second amendment forever!

<a title="<p>You see this camera after making your first portal right after you get the blue portal-gun.  Like any good mad-scientist you're pro-technology but anti-the-man (aka: The Fools).  So kill the camera and cackle a bit." rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_02_first_camera.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_02_first_camera_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

You see this camera after making your first portal right after you get the blue portal-gun. Like any good mad-scientist you&#8217;re pro-technology but anti-the-man (aka: The Fools). So kill the camera and cackle a bit.

<a title="<p>Yeah, take that.  The only cameras I tolerate are MY cameras watching MY test subjects run MY deadly gamut of tests.  Whoever put me here (said Fools) is (are) going to pay." rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_03_first_camera_dead.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_03_first_camera_dead_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Yeah, take that. The only cameras I tolerate are MY cameras watching MY test subjects run MY deadly gamut of tests. Whoever put me here (said Fools) is going to pay.

<a title="<p>To get to the second camera, we need to use some fancy portal physics that might elude the first-time player.  Namely: using the orange portal as an entrance.  First, shoot a blue portal through here..." rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_04_second_camera_1.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_04_second_camera_1_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

To get to the second camera, we need to use some fancy portal physics that might elude the first-time player. Namely: using the orange portal as an entrance. First, shoot a blue portal through here&#8230;

<a title="<p>Like so..." rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_05_second_camera_2.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_05_second_camera_2_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Like so&#8230;

<a title="<p>And turn around." rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_06_second_camera_3.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_06_second_camera_3_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Turn right when you fall out of the portal, and you should see your quarry.

<a title="<p>Ker-pow! <p>Two down, one to go before hitting the elevator." rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_08_second_camera_dead.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_08_second_camera_dead_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Ker-pow!

Two down, one to go before hitting the elevator.

<a title="<p>There the third killable camera is, opposite the big LEVEL 02 sign.  Christ, this place has more cameras than Oceania, Eastasia, or London!" rel="lightbox[portal]" href="/i/12/big/02_09_third_camera_1.jpg"><img src="/i/12/thumb/02_09_third_camera_1_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></a>

Vital testing apparatus destroyed!

<a title="<p>Turn right after exiting through the orange portal for the first time and you'll see the last camera on this level.  It's a small level.

### Level 05

<a title="<p>Level five.  GLADoS says she's not monitoring this level.

<a title="<p>The last camera on this level is after you solve the puzzle and leave through the second formed orange portal.  Just turn away from the level exit and look up.

Dead cameras tell no tales.

Portal physics are neat. Since the orange portal is above the dead camera, you can see it twice in this shot. I find in some of the later levels that I work best if I think about the problem, act on it, and while trying to get the timing right I stop focusing on the weird map topography involved and just repeat the motions, lest my HEAD EXPLODE.

Anyways, that&#8217;s the last camera until level 10. We&#8217;ve offed eleven of thirty-three, so we&#8217;re 1/3rd the way there! And that&#8217;s the last camera for this post. <a href="http://www.tenantmarket.com" target="_new">I have to go to work now</a>. Yay work!
