### Gruedorf: Airport Edition.

  <p>
    Last week&#8217;s entry was only a bare minimum of an hour&#8217;s work, the lion&#8217;s share spent on properly reforming the sully SVN so I could work on a branch while keeping the trunk sane. Thes lesson there is that infrastructure work is worth noting, and worth doing&#8230; even if it ain&#8217;t flashy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    This week&#8217;s entry has a lesson in three parts:
  </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      Using Remote Desktop Connection to develop is painfully slow.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some small amounts of work are a lot more satisfying than others
    </li>
    <li>
      Sometimes you just gotta throw old work out.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;d explain further, but frankly I&#8217;m exhausted and my plane&#8217;s taking off in 10 minutes. The short story is that I was working on rehabilitating the old SotS forest maps until I decided that the map layout is incredibly terrible and cannot be reused. Map layouts are important to try and reuse since it takes far more time to make a decent map than it does a decent tileset. Unfortunatly, you&#8217;re really not saving any time if your map&#8217;s foundation is entirely indecent.

  <p>
    So there you go. Anyone paying attention might be wondering why I was doing superficial work this week after infrastructure last week. Well, I want to roll new ideas out with some homeboys in my new digs concerning the battle system, combined with the fact that I&#8217;ve been nearly swamped with moving across the nation and visting family this week. Nonetheless, I found time to work on the project.

    After all&#8230; the alternative was losing.
