### Dot dot dot (ellipsis!)

<div style="float: right; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">
  <img src=/files/gruedorf_challenge/020/2008.03.09_omg_fu.png><br /> <span style="color: silver; font-size: -1;"><br /> <br />I hate everything.<br />Especially you</span>
</div>

I spent 8 hours on Saturday trying to get <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/paypal-direct-payment-api-component" target=_new>paypal all working with cakePHP</a> for <a href="http://breadbros.com" target=_new>breadbros.com</a> after [zara](http://zarat.us/) made an ultimatum to me.

C&#8217;est la vie.

The fun news was there was a segfault in php5, so I attempted to update it via apt-get. Long story short, things fucked up, and 12 hours of work later I&#8217;m still paying off administrative debt trying to get things on this server back the way they were before. Sorry <a href=http:/verge-rpg.com target=_new>VERGE community</a>!

So, even though I blew my weekend on this offal when I could&#8217;ve been having the sex with women and doing other debaucherizing tasks like gambling or taking The Lord&#8217;s name in vain, I decided I should also work on gruedorf. I updated the Mount Jujube map because of <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/images/news/wanton.png target=_new>the &#8220;sorry that the internets is broken&#8221; image</a> I used on vrpg to indicate that the forums and screenshot functionality are still broken. Ah, progress.

Get the update <a href=http://verge-rpg.com/svn/sully/trunk/ target=_new>here</a>. I don&#8217;t hate you. There&#8217;s over a 40% chance that that&#8217;s not a lie, too!
