**Mission Time:** 0 years, 231 days

I honestly can&#8217;t believe I haven&#8217;t been replaced yet.

Last weeks events, predictably, have had a lot of fallout. Ship to Earth communication increased about 800% in the days following, mostly due to calls from media to get interviews with crew members. We&#8217;re still close enough to Earth that the lightspeed delay is only a few seconds, so on air interviews are still possible.  Many spoke anonymously and many didn&#8217;t. No diciplinary action has been taken against those who used their names, on my orders. It&#8217;s not clear what communication with media I&#8217;m allowed to regulate/punish anyway. This is after all, a UN mission so our ship&#8217;s legal department is currently poring over the reams of regulations on the matter

UN mission command has been remarkably silent on the matter. I think they&#8217;re probably having weeks of paniced meetings down there as well, trying to figure out exactly how to fix the situation.  Until they have a solution they don&#8217;t want to worry us. At least I imagine that was the thinking when whatever contingency plan they&#8217;re following was written.

In the mean time, I&#8217;ve been having meetings with Dr. Saratoga, ship&#8217;s head psychologist. The problem, she says, is that everyone on this ship is a digusting, filthy racist.

Some background. When choosing from candidates to crew of the UNSS <span id=":1bk" dir="ltr">Ennui</span> and be the future colonists, there were several important criteria. They had to be very willing to have children, be a distinguished and successful professional in a field necessary for the colony, and had to pass a thourough mental screening. Some self selected characteristics (found in anyone who would volunteer to be a colonist) are a lack of close friends, family, spouses or children, and a degree of impulsiveness.

Maybe you&#8217;re getting the picture. The ship is full of self absorbed workaholics whose biological clocks are driving them to the brink of madness. They think the only reason they aren&#8217;t founders of happy families is because they haven&#8217;t met any equally &#8220;serious&#8221; people. What do you think happens when these people are confronted by thousands of other people like themselves and confined in a ship with them? The mirror is unkind.

The second half of the problem is, again, with the fact that this is a UN mission. Have you ever done a calculation of how many single people of the opposite sex, who are roughly your age group, who you find attractive and they would find you attractive, and not currently in relationships exist in the population of, say, your city? Well that&#8217;s your city, where the cultural gap between you and other people is somewhat limited by geography.

Often different groups in the same country has several different cultures who have gaps too large to be able to communicate effective. As this is a UN mission our population is a sickeningly rich tapestry of cultural diversity, wherein Dr. Saratoga has teamed up with statistician Dr. Minoh and computer modeler Dr. Hakeem to identify over 800 individual cultural groups that absolutely refuse to date ourside of their group. The largest group, about 7% of the ship&#8217;s population, is the group who will only date in a group other than their own. While this group has the shortest relationships on average, they also have the most and are, thus far, the happiest.

I&#8217;m not even considering the possibility of sending these findings to central command.

Captain Richards out.
