Work continues apace over at [spriteright.com](http://spriteright.com) on the html5 version of The Sully Chronicles. I&#8217;ve renamed the engine to remove confusion: it&#8217;s not java, it&#8217;s javascript, and it&#8217;s not verge, it&#8217;s verge-like.

Anyways.

There&#8217;s now event activation (both talking-to-things, like Sully and Sancho, and walking on things, like the door of the hut). I&#8217;m currently working on getting entities spawning and walking around at which point I&#8217;ll focus on making a more-better collision-detection system, better obstructions, and fix the music back up.
