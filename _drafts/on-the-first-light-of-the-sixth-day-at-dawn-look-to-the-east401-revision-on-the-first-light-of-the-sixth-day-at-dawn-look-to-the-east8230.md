I am back.Â  The hands on the ol&#8217; <a href=http://www.johnweng.com/gruedorf/>gruedorf aggregator</a> say I&#8217;m 6 days and nearly 17 hours late.

Whoops.

Let&#8217;s commemorate my return with a little project centered around the reason for my delinquency!<figure id="attachment_402" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption alignright">

Today&#8217;s bundle of joy is a Google Gadget that counts down the seconds until the next time my adorable and talented girlfriend and I meet. We&#8217;re on opposite coasts, she and I, and so we only get to fly to see each other every other weekend or so. 

I forget if this widget was her idea or mine, but she contributed the artings and I contributed the codings. And here it is!
