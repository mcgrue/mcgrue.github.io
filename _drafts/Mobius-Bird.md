<div style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> the chicken and egg is a stupid question<br /> they didn&#8217;t specify it was a chicken egg<br /> whatever evolved into a chicken laid eggs
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Tobias</strong>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <strong> </strong>oh, the egg came first
</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <p>
    right<br /> yeah<br /> but it&#8217;s allegorical
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> if you do specify it was a chicken egg then you have an egg with chicken DNA<br /> it&#8217;s still the egg<br /> since the mutation that crossed the line into being a chicken didn&#8217;t happen after the egg was laid
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>Tobias</strong></div> 
    
    <div style="text-align: center;">
      what about things that lay eggs and eggs</p> 
      
      <p>
        <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> thing that lays eggs<br /> evolution helps with that one too
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tobias</strong><br /> right<br /> what about things that lay eggs and hatched from eggs, and eggs
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> eggs<br /> something that wasn&#8217;t hatched from an egg layed an egg for some arbitrary definition of &#8220;egg&#8221;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tobias</strong><br /> what about things that lay eggs and hatched from eggs, and eggs that were laid by things that hatched from eggs
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> things that lay eggs and hatched from eggs<br /> you just moved it back a half generation<br /> I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a way to define the question that makes it unanswerable
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tobias</strong><br /> well you could define a chicken as an animal that hatched from a chicken egg, and a chicken egg as an egg that was laid by a chicken<br /> now which one came first
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> alright lets see<br /> there&#8217;s no genetic diffence between the egg and whatever hatched from it<br /> so the first chicken egg came from a non-chicken
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tobias</strong><br /> but thats not a chicken egg
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> ok a non-chicken laid a chicken-containing egg that was not a chicken egg<br /> the chicken containing egg hatched into a chicken
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tobias</strong><br /> no, chickens only come from chicken eggs
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> oh right<br /> ok, non-chicken-bird laid a chicken-like-animal-containing egg<br /> &#8230;wait<br /> according to your definition there has never been and will never be a chicken
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tobias</strong><br /> but there is, therefore god exists
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Jonas</strong><br /> no even if god exists, he either made a chicken or an egg<br /> but that chicken wasn&#8217;t a chicken since it didn&#8217;t hatch from an egg<br /> so there still has never been and never will be a chicken
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>Tobias</strong><br /> he made a chicken that hatched from an egg it laid itself
      </p>

        Questions that are not profound but are actually just semantic
