    The most pedestrian screenshot ever. To what depths has this once-mighty work-journal fallen?

My <a href=http://www.johnweng.com/gruedorf/>gruedorf</a> showings are shameful of late, and so are all of yours. The only one holding the line at this moment is Ustor. Perhaps this should be called &#8220;UstorUstor&#8221;. Or &#8220;TorUs&#8221;.

At any rate, my small token to personal projects this week is the file management section&#8217;s edit page. Woo, now you can edit your files once they exist. Necessary, and very quotidian to a web developer.

Up next on this mystical journey is the upload section&#8217;s frontpage, featuring most downloaded recently, newest files, and staff picks (aka, <a href=http://verge-rpg.com/demoalarm/>Demo Alarms</a>). After that, we&#8217;re a docs section from release. At this point, I think I should screen-scrape my old site&#8217;s documentation and import all of that into a wiki. Anyone have objections?
