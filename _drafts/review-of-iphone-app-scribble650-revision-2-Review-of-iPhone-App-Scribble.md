I was in the doctor&#8217;s office today, and just as a Hobbit Hole means Comfort, a doctor&#8217;s office means _waiting_.

So I pulled out my trusty iPhone looking for some diversion. After catching up on my <a href=http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific>Twitter feed</a>, I looked around hungrily for something new. I scanned through the games section and tried to buy the <a href=http://gizmodo.com/5070894/square-enix-making-final-fantasy-based-iphone-game>Square-Enix iPhone Game</a> only to be told to go bugger off because it was over 10mb in size and I wasn&#8217;t on a wifi network.

Balls.

So I went through what apps I had locally, and decided to give the paint app I&#8217;d downloaded months ago a fair shakedown. I wasn&#8217;t too impressed with it in the past, but I didn&#8217;t spend more than a minute trying. And now I had all the time in the world&#8230; or at least in the office.

Unfortunately, my initial assessment was correct: <a href=http://www.mspaintadventures.com/>MS Paint</a> puts this app to shame.

#### colors

In Scribble, you have a finite set of 11 color options. You cannot change them. And while I often will fight the fight of &#8220;<a href=http://www.foolstown.com/en/pixel/>very limited color palettes create superior art</a>&#8220;, the limited color palettes I speak of aren&#8217;t 11 colors, and those colors aren&#8217;t straight out of the <a href=http://www.shoplet.com/office/db/BIN523008.html>cheapest pack of crayons</a> you can get.

It is not very much to ask that, at the least, palette slots be changeable. Even though there&#8217;s no default color picker widget in the iPhone&#8217;s api, there _are_ sliders, and there is a handy-dandy keyboard/textfield interface in which you could type hex codes. 

### Tools

The tools provided are: smallish circle pen, medium circle pen, and large circle pen. And that&#8217;s it. No undo, no 1-pixel-size pen, no zoom, no anything other than three pens. While I admire simplicity in design, this goes beyond that. The tools you are given are limited without the ability to zoom in/out and undo mistakes.
