I&#8217;ve mainly been dealing with code concerning the files section.  I&#8217;ve improved the quality of the upload process, corrected the file lineage graph and made strides towards a saner system, have made it so you can comment upon file entries, and made it so anyone can upload screenshots of any file.

Also I made an schema-application tool to keep track of which .sql files have been applied in what environment.  Trust me, this is useful.

So where did I go for two months, far, far away from Gruedorf?  I honestly can say I was shocked to crack open this dev folder to find the last svn log from _July 10_.  So wherever I went, it didn&#8217;t seem as long as it was. :(
