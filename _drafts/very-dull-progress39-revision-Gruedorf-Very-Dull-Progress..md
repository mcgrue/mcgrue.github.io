  * [boards are now listable](http://beta.verge-rpg.com/boards/) 
      * [individual board listings are now visible](http://beta.verge-rpg.com/boards/) 
          * [individual postings are now visible](http://beta.verge-rpg.com/general/320x240-problem/) 
              * [And the urls are sane and awesome. Even for pages.](http://beta.verge-rpg.com/general/new-to-verge-start-here/2/) </ul>
