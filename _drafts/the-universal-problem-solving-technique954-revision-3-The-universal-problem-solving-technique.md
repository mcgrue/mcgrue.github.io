1. Find an error message.  
2. google that error message in quotes.

If 2 fails, google substrings of the error message.

Only after several failed iterations of this process should you bug your cool programmer friends. You&#8217;ll be glad you did. They&#8217;ll be glad you did.

And, if you actually needed to ask your cool programmer friends for help (or discovered the answer yourself in spite of failed searches) you should make a public blog post with the error message itself in the title and the entire problem you experienced (with solution) in the body.

In this way, you are improving the internet and making the next guy&#8217;s life easier. Also, writing about the solution will help you remember it yourself next time, so it&#8217;s a double-win.
