My <a href=http://www.johnweng.com/gruedorf/>gruedorf</a> showings are shameful of late, and so are all of yours. The only one holding the line at this moment is Ustor. Perhaps this should be called &#8220;UstorUstor&#8221;. Or &#8220;TorUs&#8221;.

At any rate, my small token to personal projects this week is the file management section&#8217;s edit page. Woo, now you can edit your files once they exist. Necessary, and very pedestrian.
