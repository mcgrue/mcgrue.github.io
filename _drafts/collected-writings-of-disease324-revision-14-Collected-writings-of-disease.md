Since Ben/McGrue is sick and is failing pretty hard at Bloodsport Bare Knuckle Blogging, I thought it&#8217;d be appropriate to post something about being sick that&#8217;s been percolating nicely in the drafts repository.

## It hurts where I LIVE

You know you&#8217;re retarded sick when your eyes hurt. That&#8217;s right, retarded sick. I&#8217;ve been sleeping all day, my nose is stupid red, an entire roll of toilet paper is crumpled up into little wads next to my bed, and my body can&#8217;t make up its mind what temperature it wants to be. Right now I feel hot AND I&#8217;m sweating, a rare bit of consistency from an otherwise barely functioning wreck of a thing. Too high, you say? Well fuck you, body. You wanted it hot, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to get you son of a bitch.

I catches me off guard that I can&#8217;t talk. If you go a good 12 hours without speaking to anyone it suprises you when you try and find you can&#8217;t.

It occurs to me that this might seem like I&#8217;m begging for pity so let me explain how my life is still better than yours.

First off, location, location, location. I get to be sick as a dog in NYC. If there were a place in the world to not be able to enjoy, NY is the one you&#8217;d get the most non-enjoyment from. The awesome job I&#8217;m staying home from, and that isn&#8217;t paying me while I do, is also awesome.

The one time I left my house today I went to the grocery store and bought about $25 of canned soups. Why? Because my mommy isn&#8217;t going to make soup for me on account of being thousands of miles away. She doesn&#8217;t even have to know I&#8217;m sick. You know what freedom from parental nagging tastes like? It tastes like Progresso Vegetable Minestrone. High in saturated awesome.

So don&#8217;t cry for me Argentina. The truth is I wrote this months ago and I&#8217;m healthy as all fuck now. The cans of soup that once filled my cabinets are a distant memory, and instead of a painfully dried out mouth in the morning I wake up to a smile and an erection.

* * *Well, that part added at the end about how I&#8217;m not sick anymore? Well, I&#8217;m sick again. Not so sick that I feel the need to elicit sympathy and contempt at the same time, but nonetheless sick.</p> 

Observe as I attempt to ply my ex-girlfriend to come and coddle me, complete with homemade chicken soup.

  MY MUCUS HAS STIFFENED ITS CONSITENCY AND RESOLVE BUT NOT LESSENED ITS VOLUME, I just thought you should know.

  Oh my yes

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Waking up this morning has taught me what those Christians mean by being born again
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  It remains unrevealed to me why such a thing is appealing, however

<p style="text-align: center;">
  That&#8217;s really really nasty

  <em>(ed note: realizing I have seriously miscalculated my approach, I furiously attempt to backpedal)</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  But I figured if I said it in my monocle voice it&#8217;d be ok
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em>(ed note: that was not my monocle voice)</em>
