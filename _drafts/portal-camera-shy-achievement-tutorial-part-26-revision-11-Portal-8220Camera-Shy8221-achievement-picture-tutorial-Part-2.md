Welcome back to the visual tutorial for where all of the cameras that you can destrol in in Valve&#8217;s new Portal game are. This is the second (of two) parts and the <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>first one</a> can be found <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>by clicking here</a>.

Note that the photo essay thing here is mainly for &#8220;that one effing camera&#8221; you can&#8217;t find. Really, just knowing how many cameras you should find on each level is enough to get anyone through to completetion on this Achievement, and you can find that list at the top of <a href=http://www.egometry.com/posts/view/12>part one of this tutorial</a>.

Enough chitchat. Let&#8217;s break some cameras.
