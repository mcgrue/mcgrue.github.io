### Short post, green thumb

<div style="float: right; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">
  <img src=/files/gruedorf_challenge/005/2007-11-11_0-fenslyd_greener.png alt="I wouln't've done this if I knew it'd take this long. That's probably a lie."><br /><span style="color: silver; font-size: -1;">Fenslyd Holy Mountain:<br />Now duochromatic!</span>
</div>

Today&#8217;s post is way shorter than I planned. But rather than be a twat and whine, here&#8217;s new (albeit more mundane than I was planning) work.

This update mainly shows the fruit of several hours after I posted last sunday&#8217;s entry, wherein I decided to make the Fenslyd Holy Mt. more interesting visually. The first part was to change up the floor tiles&#8230; which wasn&#8217;t so much a success. The other part was my old standby vineset. First appearing in Edenburg.map (which was from an abortive attempt to get Hahn to work on Blackstar (Ie, the &#8220;real&#8221; game starring the Sully Chronicles cast) by giving him art), these vines have crept their way into many, many tilesets of mine. The reason is simple: they break up monotony nicely, and vines are at home on rocks, on buildings, hanging from trees, etc etc. So that looks nicer.

### Really, this happened.

So, why the reason for the spare update? (and hey, that&#8217;s a few more hours of work over last time right there! Mapediting is time consuming!) Well, circumstances prompted me to reformat my main drive and reinstall windows, which ate a bunch of time, and after the reinstall I, like a fool, accidentally installed my Saitek Gaming Keyboard&#8217;s drivers, which are apparently incompatible with verge as it says &#8220;hey, verge, the up key is being pressed always!&#8221;. Hanyways, I went to Fry&#8217;s and got a keyboard (and a spare laptop to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen again. Yeah, let&#8217;s go with that as the reason! >_>) and then my roommate wanted to go to Ikea and then wanted to eat and then to Best Buy&#8230; so now it&#8217;s 6 pm and I&#8217;ve been up since this time yesterday.

So I want to sleep.

<span style="color: silver;">[17:08:28]</span> &lt;SDHawk> how can a keyboard be incompatible with something
<span style="color: silver;">[17:13:37]</span> &lt;Kildorf> this is a question that Grue was asking this morning
</pre>

Oh, also there&#8217;s newified mountain music modernized by <a href=http://zath.org>The Indomitable Zathras</a>. It&#8217;s totally hot.

Since this is mainly just a visual update I didn&#8217;t feel like making a full download zip. Anyone who wants to can feel free to grab the current build from <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/>the Subversion repository at http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/</a> (u/p anonymous/anonymous).

I am going to sleep now. Expect a way better update in a day or three. An update that&#8217;ll ROCK YOUR FREAKIN&#8217; SOCKS OFF.

That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m setting <u>expectations</u>. I&#8217;m _that_ confident. And/or full of myself.
