I was in the middle of writing a big post on my 7-year-long involvement with the upcoming indie RPG <a href=http://dredmor.com>Dungeons of Dredmor</a> by [Gaslamp Games](http://gaslampgames.com)&#8230;but then my browser crashed and wordpress doesn&#8217;t save drafts as you write them like everything by google does.

Screw you, wordpress.<div align=center> </div> 

I&#8217;ll put the history post in later. 

Anyways: for this week&#8217;s Gruedorf I&#8217;ve been beta-testing a lot. 

A _lot_.

This is actually work-ish, but I am enjoying the game. I&#8217;m also filing a lot of bugs and making vaguely Executive Producerish suggestions like &#8220;screw balance, it was more fun when you got cool shit faster, and it didn&#8217;t make it easier per se.&#8221;

Yeah, I say balance is for losers. I just wanna feel like a badass when I play games.

And so do you.
