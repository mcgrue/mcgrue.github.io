In direct defiance of what I said I wouldn&#8217;t do a scant month ago, I&#8217;m currently converting the verge-rpg.com codebase from cakephp 1.1 to 1.3. 

Why? Because I&#8217;m sick of dealing with the anachronisms from the original library. When I built pingpawn in 1.3 natively, every new feature effortlessly flowed into being. That&#8217;s the sort of thing I covet, especially after 2 weeks of chasing down bugfixes since the site re-launch.

I want this beastie maintainable, not to be in a de-facto feature-freeze for years like last time.

On r677 as of tonight. Whee!
