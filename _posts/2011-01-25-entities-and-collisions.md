Not much new this week (been busy with family in town) but that will not cease my gruedorfian obligations!

For this week&#8217;s hourly minimum sacrifice, I present: entities that obstruct!

Next up is firing events/executing code conditionally upon that (onBump?) and maybe getting to some z-ordering with entities. Right now the player walks all over the entities. Literally.
