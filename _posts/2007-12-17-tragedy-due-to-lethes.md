### Tragedy Due to Lethes.

<div style="float: right; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">
  <img alt="Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!" src="/files/gruedorf_challenge/010/2007-12-16_GODDAMNIT.png" /><br /> <span style="color: silver; font-size: -1;"><br /> Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!</span>
</div>

So, after doing a whole bunch of stuff (my first week at a new job in Silicon Valley, getting up during the morning every day, saving humanity from demon-alien nazis, etc etc) I started doing some minor fleshing-out work, adding some &#8220;local color&#8221; to one of the completed maps that won&#8217;t need major changes: Amaxis city. This whole idea of adding linear progress was Andy&#8217;s, as he has a variation on the time-vested:time-used formula I came up with many years ago to justify these endeavors.

Anyways, I converted a bunch of old sprites to v3 entities, and then scripted them out in the vc.

Then I loaded it up, it compiled fine, and as I walked into the town: whoops. I forgot that I broke my local maped3 weeks ago and haven&#8217;t fixed it yet.

If only I were a gangsta. Then I could feel good.

I totally need to do some swoll gruedorf next week in the form of repairing maped3 some. It&#8217;s obvious I&#8217;m corrupting my mapsaves in some minor, but annoying, way.

On the other side, please note I&#8217;m physically in California now, and this is the second post done via remote desktop into my computer in Austin TX. Locally it&#8217;s 11:47pm on Sunday, Dec 16th. I SO DO NOT LOSE. :D

&#8230;Ahem. Carry on.
