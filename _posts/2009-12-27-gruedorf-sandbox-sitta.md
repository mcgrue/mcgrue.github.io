This week I completed the autoschema tool that&#8217;s been long overdue to maintain a healthy database state across the four sandboxes used for development.

I also cleaned up layout errors and corrected a bug in screenshot uploading. Also improved the search result page.

Three minor files section tasks left: A directory link/listing, build the legacy 301 redirect table, and give the files frontpage some polish.

Next major task after that: the Gallery Controller.
