The boys at Gaslamp Games just cut a gold of Dredmor tonight. 

I&#8217;m safe in saying that I identified at least one major hole (item dupe), and helped sort out any number of annoying issues alongside all of the other testers in #dredmor.

Ustor and I have been continuing to augment the Achievements list as we play. Here&#8217;s some samples:  
**Yer a Wizard, ‘Arry!** &#8211; Master the Magic Training Skill Tree &#8211; _Winner of The Tom Marvolo Riddle Award for Excellent Scholastic Achievement_  
**Tastes Like Pennies** &#8211; Master the Blood Mage Skill Tree  
**Gettin’ Ley’d** &#8211; Master the Ley Walker Skill Tree

(No promises on final names or actual achievements there.)
