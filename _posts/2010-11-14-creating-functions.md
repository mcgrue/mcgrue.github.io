I got the adding/editing/deleting of functions into the documentation section.

Now the documentation system has full basic functionality.

The verge-rpg.com recode is now at revision 479. It&#8217;s taken far longer than I expected actual-time-wise, but real work-time-wise is more likely less than a man month.

I&#8217;ll be giving the site a good shakedown in the meantime and patching things up before I roll it over to being the main site. After that, the next big project starts!
