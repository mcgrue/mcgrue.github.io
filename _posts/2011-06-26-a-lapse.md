Crap, things have been busy folks. Been getting ready to leave my old job and start a new one.

A new one where I have it in writing that they don&#8217;t have any interest in any game-related side-project I ever work on! ;D

Anyways: This week&#8217;s gruedorfing activities include working on a refurbished breadbros.com (not yet launched), and starting a Hello World for android. 

(Oh, I got a Sensation 4G, and so am incentivized to put games upon it.)
