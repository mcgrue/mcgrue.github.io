Ohboy. _Notes_.

See, I take my notes on blank white filler paper, usually taken from the surplus feed-paper in the South Pod, which I rip off in stacks of 50 or so and then tear off the side-hole paper. What remains gets affixed to one of my numerous clipboards and I use it like a long scroll of paper, equally suited for writing notes as it is for drawing during a particularly boring class.

The stuff at the top of this is actually a note pertaining to <a href=http://www.informit.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0130844667&redir=1 target=_new>Prof. Steflik&#8217;s</a> proclaimation about the most efficient trees being order 52 to map to the drive sector structure on something or other that I passed to <a href=http://www.metzenweb.com/ target=_new>Matt MacDonald</a> in front of me. His answer is the different and much smaller font.

The rest of it is Gopher and LDAP shite. And a stupid question that the Prof didn&#8217;t know the answer to (What _is_ an Irregular Function, dammit? A quick google didn&#8217;t prove informative.)
