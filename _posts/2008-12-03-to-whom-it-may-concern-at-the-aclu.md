There&#8217;s been a grave injustice and I don&#8217;t know who else to write to to get it resolved.

You see, [Ben](http://www.egometry.com/about/) recently gave me a user name and password to contribute to his blog. A triumph for free speech, at first glace. But once I began to write some well researched prose about why evolution is wrong and how Harri Krishnas were responsible for 9/11, I noticed that I didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;publish&#8221; button. Instead, I had a &#8220;Publish Pending Review&#8221; button.

As Ben well knows, we do not practice prior restraint in this country. I cannot abide being censored by an unchallengeable authority such as &#8220;McGrue&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure you agree serious actions need to be taken to remedy the situation immediately.

Furthermore, the free exercise of my religions is being impeded, as a central tenet of my religion is that I&#8217;m always right and everyone else should be forced to listen.

He also may have impeded my second amendment rights when I tried to shoot him.

PS: Also the preview button didn&#8217;t work the first time I clicked it, and as a result I feel like I&#8217;ve been forced to quarter soldiers in my house.
