  * Added team and role access filtering for forums. 
      * Added custom sorting to forums. 
          * Added some style to forum pre&#8217;s. 
              * Fixed the 404 rendering. 
                  * Fixed registration so passwords are encrypted in the database. 
                      * Added delete/undelete links in post rendering for forum_admins&#8230; but not for custom forum mods/admins or the actual ability to delete/undelete threads. 
                          * Refactored how messages are rendered and how forum/thread/message permissions are calculated. 
                              * Did some ground work for private/team forums. 
                                  * Set up a schema for testing said forums, and testing posting in general. 
                                      * Tightened behavior of trying to post when not logged in. 
                                          * Fixed login redirect behavior. Twice. </ul> </p> 
                                            One day I&#8217;ll get back to making games, instead of infrastructure for games. Honest. ;)
