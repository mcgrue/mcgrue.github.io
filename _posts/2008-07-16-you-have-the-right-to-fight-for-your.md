&#8230;okay, no, I won&#8217;t finish that.

Today&#8217;s a bit on the lame side. I fleshed out the remaining forum features in tests that fail, and made several go green. The ones that went green all pertain to the visibility of forum features to admins and the invisibility of said features to non-admins.

Exciting, eh? revision 145 is tonight&#8217;s last.
