### Guards!

<div style="float: right; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">
  <img src=/files/gruedorf_challenge/019/guard.gif width=72 height=128><br /> <span style="color: silver; font-size: -1;"><br /> <br />It&#8217;s the po-po.</span>
</div>

I&#8217;ve decided that the testing and systems-shoring-up need to be done on the sully side of things, and that my SotS efforts should be directed towards making some playable demoage. Towards this end I pulled together my favorite versions of sprites from the previous build and have been upgrading them. Today&#8217;s entry: the Alden Castle Guards. 

<div style="float: left; padding: 4px; margin: 4px;">
  <img src=/files/gruedorf_challenge/019/guards!.png width=111 height=195><br /> <span style="color: silver; font-size: -1;"><br /> <br />Now in three flavors!</span>
</div>

The animations are completly done on this one, and he&#8217;s got three different flavors: Private, Captain, and Gold! These three sprites will be littered all over the castle, and provide a bit of variety without too much extra work.

Next up will be the Alden Mages, Amin, and Ilsdan. Once I&#8217;ve got those all out of the way, I&#8217;ll continue on by actually coding up an intro segment.

Please feel free, once again, to check out the current demo&#8217;s build over at <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/>http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/</a>.

Now it&#8217;s time to do my laundry!
