Well, about a 10 hour bender later and I have viewing galleries re-implemented. This would&#8217;ve gone much, much faster if I was using cakePHP1.3, but I&#8217;m not spending the time porting everything I&#8217;ve done to the new system at this time.

The short story is: vrpg has galleries again, and now you can comment on them.

Next update will be about creating new galleries. >_>

I also have been slaying bugs and reporting them over at this thread: <http://verge-rpg.com/forums/website-issues/the-website-bugfix-thread>

Hopefully there&#8217;s only a few more full days of work in this project. The galleries are one of the biggest chunks left (that I&#8217;m aware of).
