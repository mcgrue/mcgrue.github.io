In the past week I&#8217;ve [re-launched verge-rpg.com](http://verge-rpg.com/forums/news/deployed-the-new-site). It&#8217;s now in a form that works more consistently across all browsers, and you can actually login and upload files consistently.

Hooray!

And then the bug reports started coming in. (Which is to be expected and respected.)

I&#8217;ve blown through 30 revisions since the launch crushing bugs, and I have a full coffer to go through for a few days yet. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have everything already-reported dealt with by this time next week. 

I&#8217;m&#8230; eager&#8230; to start the next iteration of verge dev tools.
