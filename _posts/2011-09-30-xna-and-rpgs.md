I may have stayed up until 7am with Zeromus at some point this week working on making verge games work in XNA.

Okay, that&#8217;s a thing that actually happened. There isn&#8217;t (and won&#8217;t be) scripting conversion, but you can totally run maps and chrs and such in an xbox atm. Which is interesting.

So, there&#8217;s that.
