Currently on revision 116, and putting in all the nooks and crannies of forum administration&#8230; including the ability to create boards. Whee.

No rest for the wicked. You can visit the <a href=http://beta.verge-rpg.com>beta site</a> to check out the progress, or you can email me for a read-only account on the SVN repo.

Of frustrating note is that several more tests are red on the server than in my local sandbox. It is to sigh. But it&#8217;s better to know that things are all broken right from the get-go than to whine &#8220;but it wooooorks on myyyyy box&#8221; and do nothign about it.
