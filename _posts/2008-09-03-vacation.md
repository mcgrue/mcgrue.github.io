I&#8217;m on vacation, but I&#8217;m still working on stuff!

I fixed the head revision of <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/verge3/trunk/tools/maped3/>Maped 3</a>, for one. Now you can build maped 3 from source and save a map and verge 3 can use it again. Yay! (note: this flaw was only in the SVN version, we never publically released a bad build).

I also added some new things to <a href=http://spriterite.com>spriterite</a>, notably hooking in the color switcher and the color picker. Whee!

Troupe and I also did some brainstorming on the Perseus Project last night. And by &#8220;brainstorming&#8221; I do, in fact, mean &#8220;got shitfaced on home-mixed long island iced teas&#8221;.

I&#8217;m still drunk 12 hours later :(
