Today&#8217;s gruedorf updat brings a full, completed mapswitch. You can leave the island and go to the undersea cavern (and back) once you complete your conversation with Crystal.

Progress is slow lately, but I&#8217;m hoping to have time over the weekend to do some impressive stuff. Map Parallax and single-layer lucency is next on my list. And finishing all of the undersea cavern scripting.
