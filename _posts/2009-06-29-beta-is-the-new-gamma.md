Work continues apace on beta.verge-rpg.com.

Actually, it&#8217;s quite brisk now. Almost 60 revisions have passed in the last week.

Gayo and crew have banged on the forums, and I patched several oversights. Locally I&#8217;ve moved on to the new downloads section, which I&#8217;m looking forward greatly to finishing. Mainly so there can be an upload script that works for most users and gives progress feedback.

Are all webapps 98% mundane crap? I&#8217;ve been doing them for almost a decade now, and I think I have an answer.

(The answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;.)
