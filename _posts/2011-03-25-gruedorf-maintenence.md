This week&#8217;s update is not sexy game development, but website maintenance. I fixed problems on vrpg concerning inefficient database queries (a specific query was getting hammered too much and was better replaced with a non-db code-defined data structure), updated the files page (static content) to point to the current verge executables, and started debugging problems with the image uploader (still in progress.)
