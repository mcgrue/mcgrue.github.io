### And so it goes&#8230;

This week&#8217;s entry is another lightweight one, finishing up the animation of the new Proto-Onam (Pronam?). 

Onam&#8217;s finally got the quarter-cape he&#8217;s always wanted, and a asymmetrical sprite to boot. Hooray!

### The great move ends

So I now am in my new apartment in Mountain View, California. It took like, six goddamned weeks to get all of my junk from there to here. I&#8217;m just about done assembling furniture and unpacking, so the weak-ass updates can cease and the strong-ass updates will commence. Including a long-overdue vrpg post declaring losers and not-losers. Of course&#8230; before I do that I&#8217;ll be sure to make a really impressive post here so I look awesome. Gruedorf is a lot like life: not very fair.

### The repository

Remember kids, the updates are always viewable live at <a href=http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/>http://www.verge-rpg.com/svn/sots/</a>. Ioachim yelled at me for forgetting to mention that for the past few posts&#8230;
