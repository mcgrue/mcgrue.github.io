This week I got a demo running on an iPhone emulator of a tile engine. Tiles render, you can scroll across the map, tap and/or double-tap on a tile to access information associated with it, and draw text. Whee. I did this with the assistance of Rusty Larner from work, while pairing in my living room.

I also started work on a map editor coded in vc. If everything goes well, Overkill will be joining in on this on his next update.

Finally, I updated the Sully codebase to the mark 5 render engine: now with fully functional clickable renderstack items! Yay!
