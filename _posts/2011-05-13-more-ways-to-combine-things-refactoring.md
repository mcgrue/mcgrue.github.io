At the all-night SHDH last weekend I added more tools to the mix and started in on some necessary helper functionality, most important of which is the ability to add items to your inventory programatically. (previously your starting inventory was only in the markup, and items could only be converted, never created.)

Next up is base item spawning (an unending supply of rocks, water, and cats!) and a trashbin.
