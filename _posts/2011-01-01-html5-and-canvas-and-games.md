Hey look, a gruedorf entry without me working on a website!

What have I been working on this week?

Hey look: <a href=http://javerge.com>Sully in a web browser!</a>.

I registered &#8220;javerge.com&#8221; on a whim because I have a terrible, terrible problem with purchasing domains. This is a WIP experiment that actually has little to do with VERGE structurally. It&#8217;s all javascript and html5 canvas, with a little flash for the music-playing capabilities. But it is verge-related and I&#8217;ve been making asset conversation, so whatever.

I&#8217;m still looking for a name for the engine, right now I&#8217;m thinking somethign Sully related, like Clam Engine or Lord Stan or Castle Heck.

Or &#8220;No Caves&#8221;.

Whatever. Anyways, it&#8217;s pretty early in and non-optimized, but I&#8217;m having fun banging it out. You can grab the code at <a href=https://github.com/mcgrue/js-verge>https://github.com/mcgrue/js-verge</a>. 

The license will be BSD or MIT. Probably MIT because I need to show off my East Coast Cred in this here West Coast Silicon Valley. EST 4eva!!!1
