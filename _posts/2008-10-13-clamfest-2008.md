### Clamfest 2008!

Although this isn&#8217;t all I&#8217;ve done in the last week, I&#8217;ll focus on Sully.

I&#8217;m tired, so I&#8217;ll just recap from the SVN logs. Here&#8217;s a selection of entries I made in the last week, from revision 108 to revision 143 (most of those are mine, some are Gayo.)

  * Fixed the queueing problems. Now actions properly have charges and delays. 
      * Making it so allies always animate on battle start. 
          * Added initialization code for the sprite engine. 
              * Added the revive spell&#8217;s unique effects. 
                  * Implemented effects for Revive and Shield. 
                      * Augmented GATTACA for arbitrary string display 
                          * Generified Standard Battle effects 
                              * Added an onComplete function to GATTACA. 
                                  * Added multi-stike to BasicAttackFunc. 
                                      * Added the bottoms to many palm trees in the simpletype_overworld.map 
                                          * Updating stuff to make strikes work better. Sworddance is in, functionally. 
                                              * Fixing the battle menu so the &#8220;b-side&#8221; can be triggered. 
                                                  * Fixing a McFAIL bug where custom keyboard mappings would crash if you changed to custom joystick mappings. 
                                                      * Fixed the battle_menu/McFAIL interplay. Now all is well. 
                                                          * Fixed the &#8220;non-battle items showing up in battle&#8221; bug. 
                                                              * Added Meditate as a usable action. Added TARG_SELF as a targetting function. 
                                                                  * Got the Skill Menu to not hate usable skills quite so much. 
                                                                      * Update menu to use mcgrender. 
                                                                          * OMG SLIDEY MENU 
                                                                              * BETTER SLIDEY! 
                                                                                  * EVEN MORE SLIDEY 
                                                                                      * I am king awesome. </ul> 
                                                                                        &#8230;I got excited by the end. I did awesome things.
                                                                                        
                                                                                        I&#8217;m also close to shipping an iPhone game with Rusty, but I&#8217;ll make a full post about that when it&#8217;s out.
