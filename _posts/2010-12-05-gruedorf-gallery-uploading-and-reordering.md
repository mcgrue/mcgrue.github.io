I was hoping to be done with the galleries feature by the end of this week, but even though there was a Super Happy Dev House at the Hacker Dojo, I wasn&#8217;t able to get my code-dick up this weekend.

I hear it happens to everyone from time to time.

Charming turns of vulgar phrase aside, I have uploads, thumbnailings, and reorderings of the galleries in now. The last thing to do is editing titles/description for individual pages, and some quick api calls so I can build a frontpage widget that cycles through screenshots all sexy-like.
