I&#8217;m in the process of converting from the silly non-functional menu (summoned and dismissed with &#8216;M&#8217; on http://spriteright.com) to a fully formed RPG menu that actually &#8220;shows data&#8221; and &#8220;does stuff&#8221;. It&#8217;s relatively slow going this week, mainly refactoring and a minimum of actual time put in, sadly. I think I&#8217;ve only squeezed 2 hours into gruedorf this week. Sickness and work and life, etc&#8230; :(

At any rate, I&#8217;m looking forward to getting the bare bones of a party menu, status screen, and inventory screen in. I&#8217;ll probably be working on this aspect of the game for a few weeks at least. With luck, next week&#8217;s update will have more screenshotty goodness.
