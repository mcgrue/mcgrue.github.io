I&#8217;ve been at work on other projects recently, but it&#8217;s of note that I&#8217;m finishing up the verge-rpg.com betasite. New as of this post are all (as far as I can tell) of the display functionality for the documentation system, including talkbacks.

I think the last thing to do before I can push this version of the site over live is the adding/editing of documentations. Of course, a rigorous smoketest after that point will shake out more work, but I feel like this project is finally coming to an end.
