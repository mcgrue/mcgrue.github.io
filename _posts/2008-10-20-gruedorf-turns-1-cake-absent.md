This week&#8217;s advancements in the field of gruedorfery mainly lie in the iPhone side of things for me. Rusty and I creep ever closer to the end goal of shipping an iPhone game. We&#8217;re working, if it&#8217;s not clear, upon a [sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) clone to start with, and will progress to add features to our engine with progressively more complex games.

Of course, this may all be in vain if a verge 3 port to the iPhone comes out. Not that I&#8217;m one to start rumors&#8230;

### Gruedorf turns one, starts teething.

This marks the first anniversary of my [first gruedorf post](http://www.verge-rpg.com/boards/display_thread.php?id=131619), when a humble Grue and a pompous [](http://www.gearleaf.com)Dorf first shut up, threw down, then started swaking again.

It amuses me to see that since it&#8217;s inception, [](http://www.johnweng.com/gruedorf)twenty competitors have joined our unwinnable contest. As of this writing, 6 are in a state of &#8220;not losing&#8221;, 10 are in a state of &#8220;losing&#8221;, and 4 have defunct sites. All in all, the contest is serving some of it&#8217;s purpose, keeping some chatter and activity constantly going, but I&#8217;d like to see it grow in the next year.

I&#8217;d also like to see [](http://www.bananattack.com/blog)Overkill and [](http://stickninja.wordpress.com)Toen stop failing so much, since both have made pretty awesome things in times past.

### What is Gruedorf again?

Gruedorf is a simple contest between myself (McGrue) and Kildorf designed to promote activity in the amateur game creation community over at [www.verge-rpg.com](http://www.verge-rpg.com).

There are but two rules:

  1. If you do an hour of work on a game and post to an RSS-enabled blog about it, you are not-losing.
  2. If you fail to do work and post about it, you are losing.

It is important to note that nobody can win Gruedorf. It sure is nice when you ship a game, but doing so doesn&#8217;t free you from the eternal geas of a minimum of one hour per week. After all, we are people who profess to enjoying development.

### So what got done this year?

I&#8217;ve lost a few times, but kept up a whole bunch of progress.

  * Made progress on my game project that&#8217;s <a href=http://www.egometry.com/tag/astrad/>older than Duke Nuke&#8217;m Forever&#8230;</a>
  * Made significant progress towards finishing <a href=http://www.egometry.com/tag/sully/>The Sully Chronicles</a>, including finishing the implementation of the Battle System to a testable form.
  * Made improvements to <a href=http://www.egometry.com/tag/verge3/>verge 3</a> on an engine level.
  * <a href=http://www.egometry.com/tag/verge-rpg/>Started work on a new verge community site</a>, fully test-driving the process.
  * Worked on and am shipping an <a href=http://www.egometry.com/tag/iphone/>iPhone game</a>, using work done solely on weekends.
  * Created a spike of a <a href=http://www.egometry.com/tag/spritewright/>web2.0 sprite editor</a> over a weekend 
      * </ul> 
        And that&#8217;s about it. Moving forward I&#8217;ll be focusing on Sully, <a href=http://beta.verge-rpg.com >http://beta.verge-rpg.com</a>, and v3 for a bit. Whee.
        
        ### Oh, and new site.
        
        As a gift to y&#8217;alls, I ditched my old cakePHP spike of a blog and ported everything over to wordpress. I couldn&#8217;t justify working on the egometry source to do things that other packages did better. Leveraging other people&#8217;s work sometimes takes priority over having fun hand-rolling it, especially when you have limited free time.
        
        So, yeah. You all can now comment on my blog finally. Whee.
