Today&#8217;s gruedorf update isn&#8217;t game related! It&#8217;s pingpawn.com related!

Now you can query pingpawn for the number of quotes that match a query string. You can further filter this by quotefile.

Examples for queries of quotes containing the word taco:

http://pingpawn.com/api/count/?q=taco  
http://pingpawn.com/api/count/gayo/?q=taco  
http://pingpawn.com/api/count/grue/?q=taco

Exciting, no?
